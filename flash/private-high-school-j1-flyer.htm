              <P align=justify class=style1> We are pleased to present to you an additional option for our J-1 students. Many of our interested host families send their students to local private schools and will only host if their exchange student goes to the same school. We realize that homestays are a very important part of any academic year abroad program. It is for this reason that we strive to place each student in a family that offers a loving,                         caring family environment.  All potential host families are visited and screened by an area representative of SMG. We realize in many cultures that attendance at a small private school is a positive fact that we hope will help our             international agents. <br>

                  <td width="77%"><P align=justify class=style1> Student Management Group has worked hard to forge relationships with outstanding private high schools in attractive locations throughout the United States. We realize that students want to study in an area that offers excitement and cultural enrichment. For this reason we are working with J-1 visa private high schools in different locations throughout the United States. Tuition at these small private schools, mainly Christian and Catholic, range in price from $2000 to $6000. There is no guarantee of placement in a specific school of this price range. A quicker placement is always forthcoming in the J-1 Private Program and the odds of having a host brother/sister of a similar age is much better.<br>
                        <br>
  Students can participate in this program with a regular J-1 visa. </P>
