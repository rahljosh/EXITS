                ten months living with a Canadian host family while studying at a Canadian Public or Catholic school. It is a great way to enjoy the benefits of the Canadian educational system and intensify the learning of English or French. The student stays with a host family while attending 
                school. All families and schools are paid in this program.<br>
                <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We cooperate with Public and Catholic High Schools in 
                Ontario, New Brunswick, Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
                and British Columbia. The program offers high educational 
                standards at different levels of difficulty, including advanced university preparatory courses. Exchange students can graduate if they fulfill the criteria.</span><br>
