Foreign students come and stay with a volunteer host family and attend a local public high school. Occasionally, a small private school can also be used in this program as well. &nbsp;A local representative selects, screens and visits the host family to ensure that the potential family is a caring and loving family, capable of hosting an exchange student.<SPAN
