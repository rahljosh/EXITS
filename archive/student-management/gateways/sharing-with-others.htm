                  <p>As we look around us, we see a world in need of compassion and peaceful  action.&nbsp; As we look in our neighborhood,  we see the people who are willing to engage in changing the world.&nbsp; H.E.L.P. has inspired the Northeast Region student  exchange families to design an ongoing program to meet some very specific  needs:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Adopt-a-Soldier: </strong>&nbsp;send cards, prepare packages,  write letters to soldiers serving in the Middle East<strong></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Lend A Hand: </strong>prepare kits  with blanket, nightlight, toothbrush, snack and small teddy bear for children  in the foster care system or emergency disaster areas<strong></strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Christmas  Shoe Box: </strong>purchase gifts, candy, age-appropriate gifts and pack in shoebox along  with a card for local children in need<strong></strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Exchange students, host families, friends and neighbors participate in  these programs throughout the year . . . these are ongoing programs that  require many people working together for the good of others.<br>
                    <br>
                    As you can imagine, good works like these require funding, so we have  developed programs to raise the money necessary to fund our dream of making a  difference.&nbsp; We have hosted Spaghetti  Suppers, prepared and sold Take-and-Bake pizzas, sold hand-made wreaths and  even sponsored a Sock Hop.&nbsp; It seems that  the work we put into raising the money was almost as fun for us as it was for  those who received special attention from us.<br>
                    <br>
                    One of the wonderful benefits of our work has been partnering with other  organizations throughout the region in order to achieve our goal of making a  difference in the lives of others.&nbsp; Each  project has allowed us to demonstrate what a great program International  Student Exchange is.&nbsp; We have students  from around the world creating relationships with American friends with the end  result of a better world . . . one filled with compassion.&nbsp;<br>
                    <br>
                    We have helped dozens of children, college students and soldiers and, in  the process, been examples of what can happen when we work together for the  good of others.&nbsp; The appreciation of  those who received gifts from us and the students who helped are amazing.. <br>

                    Dear Sheryl  and Students,<br>
                    <br>
                    I received  your package a couple of days ago.&nbsp; I  must say &ldquo;WOW!&rdquo;&nbsp; and of course <u>thank  you</u>.&nbsp; When I first saw the package  lying on my rack, I didn&rsquo;t know what to think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    When I  finally came to, I thought it was joke&hellip;Ha Ha.&nbsp;  And of course, once I saw my address I was overwhelmed with joy.&nbsp; My Marines and I greatly appreciated the X-mas  tree.&nbsp; It now sits in the center of our  room &ndash; decorations and all.&nbsp; That tree  brings a little bit of home to Iraq.<br>

                  Sheryl, Students, and Host Families,<br>
                  <br>
                  Hello everyone, today was a good day.  Let me tell you guys why.  Earlier, I was just sitting on my rack watching some movies and my buddy threw this package on my lap.  Getting packages makes me happy, but when I saw who this package was from.  I immediately became overwhelmed with joy.  I can't tell you the level of appreciation that I have for such great support, even worldwide. haha.  I know I said this last time, but it definitely means a lot to me when people take time out of their day to complete mine.  So I thank you with all of my heart and am looking forward to seeing each and everyone of you at Bangor.<br>

                  <em>...Ben would have been lonely more than ever with  the threat of death. I am pretty sure the Christmas  Shoe Boxes lessened his pain. When we did the Spagehtti Dinner and Sock Hop  party, I was glad to see the people's beautiful smiles. The Community service  added my pleasure to be in America.  It was really nice experience</em><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<strong>Juan Morales from Mexico said this:<br>
</strong><em>&nbsp;I feel pretty good doing this  project because i feel like im doing good and the one i like more was the adopt  a soldier because&nbsp;i know we did a good for him because he is so far away  of home in other country and no body take care of him. i know how is feel be  away of home so that make me feel like i feel now with people who take care of  me, is for that is i feel like wow this really help to much to my person.</em><br>

<strong>Tadeu Soloamon from Brazil said this:<br>
</strong><em>About the projects, i was here only  to join the care bags project and the 'soldier' project.<br>
Those projects, are a good opportunity, for us, Exchange Students get together,  have fun, share our culture, and also, help people. We had really good times,  working on the bags, trying to raise money. Personally, i think it's would be a  good idea to keep those projects for the next students.<br>
</em><br>
<strong>Mila Zivkovic from Germany said this:<br>
</strong><em>I liked all the projects we did. It  was cool to do good things together with nice people and having fun at the same  time! I also thought it was very nice of the couple, who were so nice and  hosted us in their bed &amp; breakfast without expecting anything, at the time  we had the<br>
spaghetti dinner in Millinocket.</em></p>
