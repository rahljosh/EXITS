      <p>Let your local representative help you in finding  that special son or daughter that matches your family. Your local  representative will check new student applications as they are processed in  their National Office and will assist by pre-selecting a student or students  that meet your family&rsquo;s interests, hobbies and lifestyle, on a first come first  serve basis. Your student match will be available to you for 3 days before  being offered to other families. By completing and submitting this form, you  are starting your intention to host an exchange student selected by you from  students matched to or selected by your family. The SEA program members will  support you, your family, and your school throughout your experience. <br />
