      <p class="bodycopy">Cultural Academic Student Exchange (CASE) is a non-profit, educational and cultural organization founded in 1988 on the belief that international student exchange promotes understanding, respect and goodwill among people of all nations. CASE brings foreign teens together with US volunteer host families. Our program grants students, host families and entire communities the ability to discover and value other cultures, which ultimately increases international harmony and creates lasting friendships.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">Our program enables students from over 25 countries, ages 15 to 18 years old, to experience the American way of life by living with an American host family and attending a local high school, either for a full year or one semester. Students are carefully screened and selected by our international partners to be sure they possess academic achievement, exemplary character, adaptability, and a good command of the English language. Host families provide students with room and board as well as a loving home. They must demonstrate a willingness to share their lives with a foreign teen and have the student become part of their family.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">CASE is fully listed with the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET) and is also designated by the Department of State as a sponsor for the J-1 high school exchange visitor program.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">CASE is proud of its mission to “Bring the World Together, One Student at a Time.” We truly believe that our program is making a difference in the world and that our young people and volunteers are fostering international friendships that will reach millions of people and help to make our world a better place.</p>
