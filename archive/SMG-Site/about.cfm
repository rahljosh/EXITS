         <p class="textAbout">Student Management Group is an international consulting company that focuses on educational programs for students of all ages and specializes in student foreign exchange programs.  Regardless of what kind of program SMG represents and assists, the goal is to always bring people of the world closer together.  Student Management Group represents several organizations and companies in the United States and around the world.  It is truly proud to represent the newest secondary independent school in the United States.  Other than a few small boarding-type schools, Granby Preparatory Academy is the first and largest independent high school to open in the last ten years in the United States.  SMGâ€™s work is to ensure that Granby Prep becomes successful in all areas such as foreign recruitment, qualitative curriculum, educational building renovations and the hiring of trained teachers experienced in working with foreign high school students.</p>
<p class="textAbout">The founder of Student Management Group, Wayne Brewer, is an experienced high school teacher and administrator as well as being involved in working with foreign exchange students for over 35 years.  He is also the current President and CEO of International Student Exchange located in Babylon, NY.  His wife is a thirty year veteran of secondary education and has worked for several exchange organizations in the business divisions since her retirement from public education.</p>
<p class="textAbout">SMG assists foreign exchange organizations in the United States with many aspects of their company-wide training for their representatives and managers.  Marketing and cultural training are examples of items that Student Management Group has and continues to work with international organizations abroad in the area of educational programs for students coming to the United States.</p>
<p class="textAbout">Everyone at Student Management Group has been carefully selected to reflect a balance between educators and business people.  We are fully aware that such important programs require careful planning and discussion with our clients as well as care, love and attention. Student Management Gorup has a passion for its work and strives to make our mission of &quot;Working together We Can Make A Difference&quot; more than just a slogan with words.  It is why we created such a consulting organization.  
We can indeed make a difference in this work by working together on meaningful, educational programs for foreign students as long as we have a common goal.  To love what we are doing and to be involved in such special programs with special people make it all worthwhile.</p>
