<h3>About Sweden</h3>

<p>Sweden has a lot more than meatballs and IKEA to offer. Sweden's
exceptional natural scenery and enormous tracts of untouched
wilderness are a major attraction as well as cities such as Stockholm
with natural beauty, cultural heritage and modern international
urban culture. We are a long country with big differences in
landscape between north and south. In the north we have the
mountains, the Nordic light, the bigger national parks and major
areas with forest. In the south we have more water (closer to both
the ocean and lakes), more farmland and closer between different
cities and towns. Art, music and nature are important to Swedes
not only today but also from an historical point of view. Swedes
are friendly people who enjoy travelling and experiencing new
cultures (as well as sharing their own!)</p>
<p>Even if we are proud of our
country many Swedes have visit different parts of the world and
are interested in learning more about other countries.
As an exchange student, you stay in one of
our selected host families and attend a local
school Monday to Friday. You can choose to
stay for five or ten months starting in January
or August. A typical Swedish school year
begins in mid August and ends in early June
with a ten weeks summer holiday. To become
an exchange student with us, you must be 15-18
years old upon arrival.
During your stay you will meet a lot of new friends and we encourage you to take part in the activities of the local community! Maybe you will try skiing, ice skating or mushroom picking?</p>

<p>Swedes are often having local clubs for different interests. This is a great way to meet new
friends and learn more about Sweden. You will also be able to celebrate some of our typical traditions as for Easter (March/April), Midsummer (June), Crayfish party (August) and Lucia (December).</p>
<p>You will meet regularly with your local coordinator as well as learn more about Sweden and take part in activities together with us. Your local coordinator is there to support you and answer questions.</p>
<p>You can contact him or her at anytime. During your stay you will also be an ambassador for home
culture, so be prepared for all types of questions about your country. You might wake up an
interest from Swedes to go see your country on a future holiday.</p>
