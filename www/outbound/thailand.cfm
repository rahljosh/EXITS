<h3>About Boxing and Culture in Thailand</h3>

<p>As UFC explodes in popularity in the United States, ISE has partnered with Thailand to offer this unique program to American high school students. This is a short-stay program offering an option for a 2 week or 4 week program. 2 week programs cost $1,000 and $1,250 for 4 week programs.. </p>

<h3>Description in Thailand</h3>
<p>Muay Thai is the popular Thai kickboxing and is a mixture of several techniques employed in the rest of the forms of martial arts. During the program, you will experience the culture and travel in Thailand as well as learn the art of Thai Boxing. Muay Thai, or Thai Boxing, is usually regarded as a very hard, external style of martial arts. It is referred to as &quot;The Science of Eight Limbs&quot;, as the hands, shins, elbows, and knees are all used extensively. However, because of its roots in mostly Buddhist Thailand, it also has a spiritual aspect. Thai boxers typically perform Buddhist rituals in the form of dancing before beginning a match. </p>
<p>Muay Thai involves boxing techniques, hard kicking and knee and elbow strikes. Low kicks to the thighs are a distinguishing technique and stand-up grappling is also used and allowed in the ring. Muay Thai practitioners develop a very high level of physical conditioning. The training involves rigorous physical training, similar to that practiced by Western boxers. It includes running, shadow-boxing, and heavy bag work. Much emphasis is also placed on various drills with the so-called &quot;Thai pads&quot;.</p>
<p>These pads weigh five to ten pounds and cover the wearer's forearms. The trainer wears the pads and may hold them to receive kicks, punches, and knee and elbow strikes or use them to punch at the trainee. This training is vaguely similar to the way boxing trainers use focus mitts. The characteristic Muay Thai round kick is delivered with the shin; therefore, the shins become conditioned by this type of kicking. Full contact, full-power sparring is usually not done in training, due to the devastating nature of the techniques employed. Thai boxers may box, hands only, with ordinary boxing gloves. Another training drill is for two fighters to clinch and practice a form of stand-up grappling, the goal of which is to try to land a knee strike. However, full-power kicks, knees and elbows are typically not used in training. Today Muay Thai is regarded as a prestigious national sport that is practiced by hundreds of thousands in Thailand with more and more Thai girls also becoming interested in the sport. It has spread over the entire world and is enjoying incredible success. It is hoped by many Thai fighters that Muay Thai will soon become an Olympic Sport.</p>

A typical day begins with an early start. This is necessary so that you are not spending the hottest hours of the day participating in intensive boxing training. You will head for a run to warm up followed by refreshments at the gym. From here you will take training exercises led by our experienced Thai Boxing trainer. Once fully warmed up you will head into the ring to spar one-on-one. Our coordinator will translate the instructor's explanations into English. He will try to teach you some Thai necessary to learn more about the sport. Please note that depending on the seasons, your itinerary may be changed. Some days you will do one early morning session and one session in the late afternoon, or you will do one longer morning session. Most weekends will be free for you to explore the local area or even go to other areas.</p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>You will spend your leisure time on the gorgeous island of Koh Samet. This is free time for you to do what you want, when you want.</p>
