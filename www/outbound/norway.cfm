   <h1>Norway</h1>

<h3>About Norway</h3>

<p>Many tourists claim that a visit to Norway is like being in a fairytale. Norway's magnificent
  scenery and untamed nature have long captivated visitors. Spectacular fjords indent the rugged coastline, stunning waterfalls and enourmous glaciers, mountains rise above tranquil valleys. Norway is the land of the midlight sun and shimmering Northern Lights.</p>
<p>This is a country where music, art and literature are part of its soul, where sports such as skiing and football are actively pursued, and current affairs are hotly debated. It is also the home of Nobel Peace Prize. The capital, Oslo is a vibrant city centered round a harbor and guarded by a castle. Norwegians are lucky to have four seasons and they all have their charm! Norwegians enjoy being one of the world's top skiing nations and the winter sports centers have something to offer everyone, both beginners and experienced skiers.</p>
<p>The arrival of spring brings long light-filled days. Norway celebrates National Day on 17th of May with children's parades and festivities. In summer Norwegians head for the islands and skerries. There are boat festivals, fairs and games all the way along the coast. Autumn is the season for theatre-going, concerts, opera (in our new stunning opera house!), dance, film premieres and art exhibitions. In essence, Norway has you everything you need!</p>
<p>Norwegians are hospitable and friendly people who will welcome you to their home with great pleasure. They enjoy travelling and getting to know new people as well as sharing their own culture. The Norwegians are proud of their country and this can be seen on the National day (17th of May), when they dress up in folk costumes also known as &quot;bunad&quot;. Yet this nationalistic outlook does not prevent them from welcoming foreigners to into their culture. It will not take long before you feel a part of the Norwegian culture!</p>
<p>As an exchange student, you stay in one of our selected host families and attend a local school Monday to Friday. You can choose to stay for five or ten months starting in January or August. A typical Norwegian school year begins in mid August and ends in early June with a ten weeks summer holiday. To become an  exchange studentwith us, you must be 15-18 years old upon arrival.</p>
<p>During your stay you will meet a lot of new friends and we encourage you to take part in the activities of the local community! Whether you enjoy sports and want to try skiing, ice-skating or football or you love culture and history; Norway has it all.</p>
<div class="picWindow2"><img src="images/norway1.jpg" width="300" height="208" /></div> 
<p>Norwegians tend to have local clubs for different interests and it is useful and fun to join in any of these clubs. This is a great way to meet new friends and learn more about Norway too. You will also be able to celebrate some of our typical traditions such as Christmas, especially the celebration of Lucia and advent in December, 17th of May â€“ our national day,</p>

<p>Easter in March/April, midsummer in June and New Years at the end of December. You will meet regularly with your local coordinator as well as learn more about Norway and take part in activities together with us. Your local coordinator is there to support you and answer questions. You can contact him or her at anytime.</p>
 <p> During your stay you will also be an ambassador for home culture, so be prepared for all types of questions about your country.</p>
