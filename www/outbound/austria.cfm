   <h1>Austria</h1>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>With an area of 83.858 sq km Austria consists of 9 independent federal states (Burgenland, Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Vorarlberg and Vienna) with their own provincial governments. Austria is a member of the European Union, the United Nations as well as most UN organizations.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 8 million inhabitants of Austria, 98% speak German. The six ethnic groups officially recognized in Austria (Burgenlandic Croatians, Roma, Slovaks, Slovenians, Czechs and Hungarians) are concentrated in the east and south of the country.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>Due to the topographical diversity and the relatively large west-east expanse, there are<br />
  three quite different climatic regions:</p>
<p><strong>East:</strong> Pannonian climate with a continental influence – low precipitation, hot summers but only moderately cold winters.</p>
<p><strong>Alpine Region:</strong> Alpine climate - high precipitation (except inner Alpine valley regions such as the<br />
  upper Inntal), short summers, long winters.</p>
<p><strong>Remainder of the country:</strong> transient climate influenced by the Atlantic (in the West) and a<br />
  continental influence in the South-east.</p>
<p><strong>Temperatures:</strong><br />
  in summer up to 95 degree Fahrenheit / average: 68 degree Fahrenheit<br />
  in winter up to - 4 degree Fahrenheit / average: 32 degree Fahrenheit</p>

<H2>Schools</h2>
<p>Pupils in Austria have to finish the four-year long elementary school, called &quot;Volksschule&quot;. Then the class teacher decides which pupil is able to manage the higher school (Allgemeinbildende Höhere Schule in German) or the compulsory school. Both school types have the same curriculum; only the learning tempo is much faster in the higher school.</p>
<p>After the four years in higher school or compulsory school, each pupil can choose between<br />
  different, specific schools which are coaching them precisely for their career. In the school<br />
  form Gymnasium they're also able to stay there and finish the schoolish matura, which is also available in career coaching schools.</p>
<p>Private schools that provide primary and secondary education and some teacher training<br />
  are run mainly, but by no means exclusively, by the Roman Catholic Church and account for<br />
  approximately 10% of the 6,800 schools and 120,000 teachers. Roman Catholic schools have a reputation for more discipline and rigor than public institutions, and some are considered elite institutions. Because there is no tradition of private university education in Austria, the state has a virtual monopoly on higher education. This has been changing slowly in recent years as private universities become more commonplace.</p>
