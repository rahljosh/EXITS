<h3>About France</h3>

<p>France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its main ideals expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. France is one of the most developed countries  and possesses the fifth largest economy by nominal GDP  and seventh largest economy by purchasing power parity. France enjoys a high standard of living as well as a high public education level,  it's one of the most globalised nations , has 2009's second best international reputation and has also one of the world's highest life expectancies,  with its healthcare system rated as the best in the world.  It is the most visited country in the world, receiving 82 million foreign tourists annually.  France is one of the founding members of the European Union. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, and a member of the Francophonie, the G8, G20, NATO, OECD, WTO, and the Latin Union. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, possesses the third largest number of nuclear weapons in the world and the largest number of nuclear power plants in the European Union.</p>

<h3>Education in France</h3>
<ul><strong>French secondary education is divided into two schools:</strong>
<ul><li>The coll&#232;ge for the first four years directly following primary school;</li>
<li>The lyc&#232;e for the next three years.</li></ul></ul>
<p>The completion of secondary studies leads to the baccalaur&egrave;at.
The school year starts in early September and ends in early-July. French school holidays are scheduled by the Ministry of Education, by dividing the country into three zones (A, B, and C) to prevent the overcrowding by family holidaymakers of tourist destinations such as the Mediterranean coast and the ski resorts. Lyon, for example, is in zone A, while Marseille is in zone B, and Paris and Bordeaux are in zone C.
In contrast to the practice in most other education systems, the various school years in France are numbered on a decreasing scale. Thus, pupils begin their secondary education in the sixi&egrave;me (6th class), and transfer to a lyc&egrave;e in the seconde (2nd class), while the final year is the terminale.
In French, the word for student (&egrave;tudiant) is usually reserved for university-level students, while coll&egrave;ge and lyc&egrave;e students are referred to as &egrave;l&egrave;ves (pupils or students in English).
The curriculum (le programme officiel) is standardized for all French public institutions. Changes to the programme are made every year by the French Ministry of Education and are published in the Ministry's Bulletin Officiel de l'&egrave;ducation Nationale (BO), the official reference bulletin for educators.</p>

<H2>Did You Know...about France?</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<ul><li>The name "France" comes from "Frank", a Germanic tribe that invaded the Western Roman Empire in the 6th century and founded the first independent kingdom covering most of today's France. 
<li>The French state is one of the oldest in Europe; it was founded in 843, splitting from the Carolingian Empire based in Aachen (Belgo-German border). 
<li>The region of Paris was settled since around 4200 BCE. The city itself was founded by the Parisii, a Celtic tribe, around 250 BCE. The Roman renamed it Luteca from 52 BCE, and it only became known as "Paris" after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century. 
<li>Foie gras may be part and parcel of French cuisine, but its origins go back to 4,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt, from where it spread to Greece (500 B.C.E.), then to the Romans, ancestors of the modern French. 
<li>Gothic art has its origins in the middle of the 12th century in the North of France. The world's first Gothic building is said to be the Abbey of St. Denis, just north of Paris, which is the burial place of many Frankish kings since Clovis, as well as most Kings of France. Gothic architecture then spread to Picardy, notably with the cathedrals of Noyon, Laon and Senlis, followed by the Île-de-France. The term "Gothic" was only used from the 16th century Renaissance as a pejorative term to describe complicated and "barbaric" art, as opposed to the simplicity of the Greco-Roman revival. Nowadays more people may value more highly Gothic than Renaissance architecture. 
<li>Nicotine was named after Jean Nicot (1530-1600), a French diplomat and scholar who introduced the tobacco plant to France in 1559 (from Portugal). 
<li>"La Marseillaise", France's national anthem, was composed in Strasbourg in 1792, not in Marseilles as its name might induce to think. 
<li>The world's first international scientific conference was held in Paris on 2 February 1799. 
<li>The first modern fire-resistant safe deposit box was invented by Alexandre Fichet (1799-1862) around 1840. 
<li>The world's first true department store was Le Bon Marché in Paris, founded by Aristide Boucicaut in 1838. 
<li>The tradition of decorating Chritmas trees started in Eastern France in the 16th century (then part of Germany). Trees were then ornated with flowers and fruits (notably apples). A drought in 1858 destroyed the apple harvest, prompting a glass blower from Goetzenbruck, a Lorraine village on the Moselle, to create apple-shaped glass baubles. The practice spread quickly around Europe, and by the late 1800's the local glass factory at Goetzenbruck was manufacturing tens of thousands of baubles. 
<li>At its peak, between 1919 and 1939, the second French colonial empire extended over 12,347,000 km² (4,767,000 sq. miles) of land, or 8.6% of the world's land area. This is over 22 times the size of modern Metropolitan France. 
<li>France has hosted five times the Summer Olympic Games (2nd most after the USA), three times the Winter Olympic Games (2nd most after the USA), and twice the FIFA World Cup (most with Italy and Germany). 
<li>France has won the 4th most Summer Olympic medals (including gold) in history after the USA, USSR and UK. 
<li>France has won the most Nobel Prizes for Literature of any country (13 so far) and the second highest number of Field Medals (mathematics) after the USA. 
<li>The capital of Malta, Valletta, was built by and named after the French nobleman Jean Parisot de la Valette (1494-1568), Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller and ruler of the island. 
<li>On 10 June 2007, a sabre having belonged to Napoleon I was sold at an auction for € 4.8 million - the most expensive weapon ever sold.</li></ul>

<h2>Culture & Sciences</h2>
<ul><li>There are some 40,000 châteaux (castles, manors, palaces...) in France. 
<li>Famous French inventions include the adding machine, the hot air balloon, the airship, the parachute, the submarine, the ambulance service, photography, animation and cinema. 
<li>France is the country that has won the most Nobel prizes for literature (13 as of 2005, with the last prize going back to 1985). 
<li>French people are the second biggest consumers of alcohol per capita in the Western world - after Luxembourg... 
<li>A 2007 study revealed that the French were the biggest consumers of medicines in Europe, both in quantity and total money spent per person. 
<li>There are over 300 kinds of cheese made in France. 
<li>There are 28 categories of sites in France listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, including 3 Roman sites (Arles, Orange and Le Gard), 4 cathedrals (Amiens, Bourges, Chartres, Reims), 4 abbeys (Fontenay, Reims, Saint-Savin sur Gartempe and Vezelay), 8 historic city/town centres (Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, Avignon, Le Havre, Mont-Saint-Michel, Provins and Carcassone) as well as numerous belfries, castles and palaces. 
<li>More tourists visit France each year than any other country in the world, with 67 million annual tourist arrivals (more than the country's population). 
<li>The spectacle "Ionesco" has been playing at the Th&egrave;âtre de La Huchette since 1957, with over 15,000 performances - a world record. 
<li>There are about 2 new cooking books published every day in France. 
<li>Pop singer Claude François (1939-1978) is still as popular as ever in France 30 years after his accidental death. Two of his songs have remained constantly in the top 10 of music played in night club for the last 20 years. A real cult has developed around him. In many ways, Claude François can be regarded as the French equivalent of Elvis Presley. 
<li>About one fourth of French people nowadays choose to be cremated when they die, instead of the traditional Catholic burial. 
<li>"Remember, if there are any complaints, in France, the customer is always wrong." (from the film A Good Year)</li></ul>
