<h3>About Spain</h3>

<p>Spain the Sea except for a small land boundary with the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar; to the
  north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the northwest and west by the Atlantic
  Ocean</p>
<p>Spanish territory also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean, the Canary Islands in
  the Atlantic Ocean off the African coast, and two autonomous cities in North Africa, Ceuta and
  Melilla, that border Morocco. Furthermore, the town of Ll&#237;via is a Spanish exclave situated
  inside French territory. With an area of 504,030 square kilometers (194,610 sq mi), it is the
  second largest country in Western Europe and the European Union after France.</p>
<p>Because prehistoric times and through to its dawn as a country. Spain emerged as a unified country
  in the 15th century, following the marriage of the Catholic Monarchs and the completion of
  the reconquest, or Reconquista, of the Iberian Peninsula in 1492. Conversely, it has been an
  important source of influence to other regions, chiefly during the Modern Era, when it became
  a global empire that has left a legacy of over 500 million Spanish speakers today, making it the
  world's second most spoken first language.</p>

<h3>Education in Spain</h3>
<ul><strong> Below Higher Education the system can be seen as consisting of four levels:</strong><br />
  <li>Pre-school (<em>Educaci&#243;n Infantil</em>, segundo ciclo) - 3 to 6 years of age</li>
  <li>Primary School (<em>Educaci&#243;n Primaria</em>) six years of schooling - 6 to 12 years of age</li>
  <li>Compulsory Secondary Education (<em>Educaci&#243;n Secundaria Obligatoria</em>) four years of schooling - 12 to 16 years of age</li>
  <li>Post-Compulsory Schooling (<em>Bachillerato</em>) two years of schooling - 16 to 18 years of age</li></ul>

<p>Children 3 to 6 years old in have the option of attending the stage (<em>infantil</em> or popularly known as <em>preescolar</em>), which is non-compulsory and free for all students. It is regarded as an integral part of the education system with infants' classes at almost every primary school. There are some separate nursery schools (<em>Colegios Infantiles</em>). Children (whose parents chose that they should) enter pre-school (<em>Educaci&#243;n Infantil</em>) in the autumn of the calendar year in which they turn three years old. Following this pattern, the ages given here as corresponding to the different phases are the ages turned by children in the calendar year in which the academic year begins. Age ranges are inclusive: 3 to 5 years of age is 3 academic years.</p>


<p>Spanish students aged 6 to 16 undergo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school" title="Primary school"> </a>(<em>colegio</em>) and (<em>instituto</em>) education, which are compulsory and (like the preceding preschool from age 3) free of charge. Successful students are awarded a Secondary Education Certificate, which is necessary to enter the post-compulsory stage of Schooling (principally the <em>Bachillerato</em>) for their University or Vocational (<em>Formaci&#243;n Profesional</em>) Studies. Once students have finished their <em>Bachillerato</em>, they can take their University Entrance Exam (<em>Pruebas de Acceso a la Universidad</em>, popularly called <em>Selectividad</em>) which differs greatly from region to region. The compulsory stage of secondary education is normally referred to by its initials: ESO (<em>Educaci&#243;n Secundaria Obligatoria</em>).</p><br />
