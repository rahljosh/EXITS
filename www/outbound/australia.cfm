<h3>About Australia</h3>

<p>Australia is a prosperous developed country, with a multicultural society. It ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance such as human development, quality of life, health care, life expectancy, public education, economic freedom and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australian cities rank among the world's highest in terms of cultural offerings and quality of life. It is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, OECD, APEC, Pacific Islands Forum and the World Trade Organization.</p>

<h3>Education in Australia</h3>
Education is compulsory in Australia between the ages of five and fifteen to seventeen, depending on the state or territory, and date of birth.  In recent years, over three quarters of students stay at school until they are seventeen. Government schools educate about two thirds of Australian students, with the other third in Catholic and Independent schools. A small portion of students are legally home-schooled.<br /> <br />
Government schools generally charge small fees incurring minor administrative costs, while Catholic and Independent schools charge larger fees. Regardless of whether a school is part of the Government, Catholic or Independent systems, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks of their state or territory. Most school students wear uniforms,  although there are varying expectations and some Australian schools do not require uniforms.</p>

<H2>Did You Know...about Australia?</h2>
<ul><li>No part of Australia is more than 1000 km from the ocean and a beach. (The point in the world that's the furthest from any ocean would be in China.)
<li>Australia has the world's largest cattle station (ranch). At 30,028 km2 it is almost the same size as Belgium.
<li>Population density in Australia is usually calculated in km2 per person, not people per km2.
<li>Australians have 380,000 m2 per person available. Yet well over 90% are cramming into our coastal cities. (Don't ask me why, I sure prefer it here in the Outback.)
<li>We call Australian's from Queensland "banana benders", and people from Western Australia "sandgropers".
<li>Tasmania has the cleanest air in the world.
<li>The Great Barrier Reef has a mailbox. You can ferry out there and send a postcard, stamped with the only Great Barrier Reef stamp.
<li>The Australian Alps, or Snowy Mountains as they are also known, receive more snow than Switzerland.
<li>Melbourne has the second largest Greek population in the world, after Athens.</li></ul>
