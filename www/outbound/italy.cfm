<h3>About Italy</h3>

<p>Italy plays a prominent role in European and global military, cultural and diplomatic affairs, and it is affiliated with worldwide organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Food Programme, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Glocal Forum, and the NATO Defence College, which are headquartered in Rome. The country's European political, social and economic influence make it a major regional power, alongside the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Russia, and Italy has been classified in a study, measuring hard power, as being the eleventh greatest worldwide national power.  The country has a high public education level, high labour force, is a globalised nation, and also has 2009's sixth best international reputation.  Italy also has the world's nineteenth highest life expectancy, and in 2000 its healthcare system was ranked the second best in the world by the World Health Organization Report. In 2007 it was the world's fifth most visited country, with over 43.7 million international arrivals, and boasts a long tradition in the arts, science and technology, including the world's highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites to date.</p>

<h3>Education in Italy</h3>
<p>Secondary education (Scuole medie) is further divided in two stages: "Medie Inferiori", which correspond to the Middle School grades, and "Medie Superiori", which correspond to the High School level.<br />
The lower tier of "Scuole Media" corresponds to Middle School, lasts three years, and involves an exam at the end of the third year; "Scuole Superiori" usually last five years (even though istituti professionali might offer a diploma after only three years). Every tier involves an exam at the end of the final year, required to access the following tier.<br />
The secondary school situation varies, since there are several types of schools differentiated by subjects and activities. The main division is between the "Liceo", the "Istituto Tecnico" and the "Istituto Professionale". Any kind of secondary school that lasts 5 years grants access to the final exam, called Esame di Stato conclusivo del corso di studio di Istruzione Secondaria Superiore or Esame di Maturit√†. This exam takes place every year in June and July and grants access to any faculty at any University.</p>

<H2>Did You Know...about Italy?</h2>
<h3>Culture, History & Sciences</h3>
<ul><li>The European Renaissance started in Northern Italy in the 14th century. 
<li>The oldest European university in continuous operation is the University of Bologna, founded in 1088. 13 other Italian universities are over 500 years old. 
<li>Europe's first modern banks appeared in Genoa in the 12th century. The first recorded public bond (1150) and the earliest known foreign exchange contract (1156) are both from Genoa. The world's oldest bank still in business is the Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, operating since 1472. 
<li>Many of the world's most famous artists were Italian, with such names as Botticelli, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Donatello, Fra Angelico, Tintoretto, Caravaggio, Bernini, Titian and Raphael, among many others. 
<li>The Italians invented the viol, violin, cello and piano, and were the greatest representative of Baroque music (Vivaldi, Corelli, Monteverdi, Albinoni...). 
<li>The mechanical clock, the barometer, the thermometer, optical glasses and the telephone are all Italian inventions. 
<li>The Romans love cats so much that they are considered a bio-cultural asset of the city. A new law condemns any person killing a cat to a 10,000 euro fine, and up to 3 years in jail. There is an estimated 300,000 cats in Rome, and they are the only inhabitants allowed on the ruins. 
<li>In 1994, Italian gynecologist and embryologist Severino Antinori (1945-) assisted the oldest women in history to give birth. 
<li>The oldest film festival in the world, beginning in 1932, is the Venice Film Festival</li></ul>

<h2>Land & People</h2>

<li>Europe's only three active volcanoes, the Etna, the Stromboli and the Vesuvius, are all in the South of Italy. Mount Etna also happens to be the world's most active volcano. It has been in quasi uninterrupted eruption for the past 3500 years, and spewing lava on a daily basis since 1999. 
<li>Two of Europe's smallest countries, San Marino and the Vatican, are enclaved within Italy. 
<li>Italy is the fourth most visited country in the world, with some 40 million foreign visitors annually. 
<li>Italy did not become a unified country until 1863. 
<li>Italy now has one of the lowest birthrate and fertility rate in the world. 
<li>There are 15 minority languages officially recognised in Italy, including native languages such as Sardinian and Friulian, and neighbouring countries' languages (Catalan, Occitan, French, Slovenian, Croatian, Albanian and Greek)
