   <h1>Finland</h1>

<h3>About Finland</h3>

<p>One of the most northern countries in Europe, this distant corner of the world has always excited people's imagination. Finland is known as a land of vast wilderness areas, white snow and the home country of Santa Claus, Nokia and heavy bands, but it is also so much more.</p>
<p>Finland is full of interesting contrasts, such as the four seasons, the midnight sun and the long winter nights and the different cultural heritages of the Eastern and Western parts of the country. The colors of Finland&rsquo;s national flag with its blue cross on a white background symbolize the country: blue represents the thousands of lakes while white stands for snow, ice and the light summer nights.</p>
<p>In terms of area, Finland is the seventh biggest country in Europe; 10 % of its surface is covered by water and 69 % by forests. The people who live in the land of winter, snow and endless summer nights are often described to be quiet and even shy, but once you get to know a Finn, you'll find a friendly, honest and warm personality underneath the calm surface. Finns are very proud of their modern welfare state and describe themselves to be a silent but strong nation with friendly and genuine people. Even though Finland is one of the northernmost countries in the world, the climate is not as freezing as one might suggest, partly because of the warming influence of the Gulf Stream.</p>
<p>Summer temperatures encourage sun bathing, and the short but spectacular spring and autumn seasons help to counterbalance the effect of the winter. And at least inside it is never cold: Finns learned long ago how to build warm houses. Finland's culture has always been strongly influenced by the seasons, winter particularly. In wintertime snow brightens up the landscape when the hours of daylight are short. In Helsinki, the capital of Finland, the contrast between the unfrozen sea and fresh, white snow is striking. In Lapland the aurora borealis lighten up the Arctic sky. The Midsummer festival is a highlight of the summer that makes people stir from the long hibernation. The sun doesn't even set at night! Finnish people sure know how to have fun during these summer months when nature is at its best. Finnish summer is full of different kind of events, festivals and concerts. It is sure to say that Finns feel happiest when sitting and relaxing on the jetty of their lakeside cottage on a summer evening. If you spend summertime in Finland, you will most likely enjoy a beautiful summer evening with barbeque, sauna and swimming in the lake.<br />

<p>It is not possible to talk about Finland without mentioning sauna! Sauna is not just the only Finnish word to have entered the world vocabulary &#8211; it&rsquo;s a ritual, an institution, an essential element of the Finnish way of life. It can also be very relaxing, exhilarating and enjoyable, and no visit to Finland is complete without sampling the sauna. The Finnish sauna has its own unique character and traditions. These days it&rsquo;s a common luxury &#8211; there are reckoned to be about 1.6 saunas for every Finn - although it was once at the very heart of rural Finland, serving as a focus for family and community.</p>


<p>In your spare time you'll have the chance to try different kinds of activities. Sport is considered a national pastime in Finland and many Finns visit different sporting events regularly. The official Finnish summer sport is a team game called &lsquo;pes&#228;pallo&rsquo;, and it is a unique hybrid of American baseball. The most popular forms of sport in terms of television viewers are ice- hockey and Formula One. Even smaller cities offer good opportunities for young people to try different kinds of sports and other activities, such as music. Local clubs are also en excellent way to meet people and make new friends. Maybe you'll find yourself a new hobby such as downhill skiing or ice hockey!</p>


<p>As an exchange student you will live in a selected host family who is ready to share their Finnish culture, language and daily life with you. In Finland, students attend school from Monday to Friday and all pupils at primary and secondary levels enjoy a free meal every day at school.</p>
<p>School year starts usually in mid August and ends in the beginning of June with a ten weeks summer holiday. During your stay in Finland, ISE organizes some trips and get together with other exchange students. You will also meet regularly your local coordinator who is there for you and whom you can contact anytime for support or questions. Finnish people are very eager to share a little of the Finnish way of life with you but they also show a great interest towards different countries and cultures. So be prepared to answer many questions about your home country. In Finland, you will most likely make friends for life!
