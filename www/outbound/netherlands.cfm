   <h1>Netherlands</h1>

<h3>About Netherlands</h3>

<p>The Netherlands has about 17 million inhabitants. The Netherlands is a country close to
the sea, which is why we have a lot of canals and windmills. We are proud of our
international location, with a harbour in Rotterdam which is the third biggest in the
world. We have a Queen, called Beatrix, she has been a Queen for 25 years.
Amsterdam is the capital, whereas Rotterdam is the second biggest city. </p>

<p>The Netherlands are very flat, we have some hills in the South, but no mountains. We do
have a lot of canals and rivers and some lakes as well, that is also why a lot of people can
ice-skate, everybody can swim and we all ride bikes. In every village you can play soccer
and/or hockey.</p>

<p>Dutch people do speak two or three languages. Because the country is small we needed
to expand in the past and we travelled all over the world to find new countries to
develop. You find people with Dutch roots all over the world. We do still travel a lot, you
can meet Dutch tourists anywhere.</p>

<p>We are an open minded nation which is also famous for her tradition, wooden shoes,
cheese and flowers.</p>

<p>An exchange to the Netherlands offers foreign students the unique opportunity to
experience one of the biggest small countries in Europe. The Netherlands is not only
famous for its wind mills, tulips and wooden shoes. Explore this country below sea level
by bike and see towns and cities surrounded by castle walls and canals.</p>

<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The Netherlands are very proud of their country and are a warm and cooperative nation. We do welcome foreign students and want to show them our culture and learn them about our habits. We are very interested in other cultures as this is a sort of second nature for us.</p>
<h3>Orientation</h3>
<p>After arrival in the Netherlands the students will have an orientation day. The students will get to know each other and they will learn about the Dutch culture and language. The orientation will take place in â€˜s-Hertogenbosch or Utrecht.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>There is no Dutch language level required, but it is better for the students to learn Dutch before arrival. The student will be supplied with Dutch language books to help them to learn the language.</p>

<h3>School Life in the Netherlands: </h3>
<p>Please note that school holidays in the Netherlands differ depending on their geographic location: North, Centre or South. As a result some of the information below may differ from region to region. Interests like playing a musical instrument and playing sports are things the students do in their free time, after school, in the village or town they live in or nearby.</p>

<h3>School Day </h3>
<p>In Holland school starts at about 08.30 a.m. and finishes at about 3.00 p.m. although<br />
  this will vary according to each student's timetable. Most students go to school by<br />
  bicycle or by public transport. There are almost no school buses. At school all students<br />
  learn 4 languages; Dutch, English, French and sometimes German. Other subjects at<br />
  school are Mathematics, Science, Geography and History.</p>
  
<h3>School Types </h3>
<p>Secondary school is divided into three levels: VMBO, HAVO, VWO. Exchange students are normally placed in the middle or higher levels, as VMBO is geared towards vocational learning.</p>

<h3>School Syllabus </h3>
<p>The syllabus varies from school to school, as the majority of schools are a mix of all three levels.</p>
