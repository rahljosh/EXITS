<h3>About Belgium</h3>

<p>The name 'Belgium' is derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that was inhabited by the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples.  Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries, which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian revolution in 1830, many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the battleground of Europe â€”a reputation strengthened by both World Wars. Upon its independence, Belgium eagerly participated in the Industrial Revolution  and, during the course of the twentieth century, possessed several colonies in Africa.  The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of communal conflicts between the Flemings and the Francophones fuelled by cultural differences on the one hand and an asymmetrical economic evolution of Flanders and Wallonia on the other hand. </p>

<h3>Education in France</h3>
<p>The Belgian secondary education grants the pupils more choice as they enter a higher cycle. The first cycle provides a broad general basis, with only a few options to choose from (e.g. Latin, additional mathematics, technology). This should enable students to orient themselves in the most suitable way towards the many different directions available in the second and third stages. The second and third cycle are much more specific in each of the possible directions. While the youngest pupils may choose at the most two or four hours per week, the oldest pupils have the opportunity to choose between different "menus", like Math-Science, Sociology-Languages or Latin-Greek. They are then able to shape the largest part of the time they spend at school. However some core lessons are compulsory like e.g. mother-tongue course, sport, etc... This mix between compulsory and optional lessons grouped in menus make it possible to keep class structures even for the oldest students.</p>

<H2>Did You Know...about Belgium?</h2>
<h3>People & Society</h3>
<ul><li>Europe's tallest man is Belgian (Alain Delaunois, 2m30) 
<li>The biggest newborn baby ever recorded was Samuel Timmerman, born in the Ter Linden Hospital in Knokke, weighing 5.4 kg and 57 cm in length. (December 2006) 
<li>The world's richest girl lives in Brussels (Athina Onassis Roussel de Miranda, granddaughter and sole heir of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis) 
<li>Many super-rich French and Dutch people have moved to Belgium (and often taken Belgian citizenship) in order to avoid wealth taxes in their country. Wealthy French people prefer Brussels, while most Dutch millionaires have elected Antwerp as their home. 
<li>In 2003, there were 884 registered Belgian comic series, up from 104 in 1985 (i.e. a 750% increase). 
<li>Belgium has more comic makers per square kilometer than any other country in the world (even Japan). 
<li>In 70 years of existence, 200 million books of "The Adventures of Tintin" have benn sold worldwide. 
<li>Half of Belgian households have at least one pet. Domestic cats and dogs alone are over 2 million in the country, for 10 million people. 
<li>97% of Belgian households receive cable TV - the highest percentage in the world. 
<li>Belgian people are the most avid users of discount coupons in the world, just before the United States. 
<li>Durbuy dubs itself the smallest town in the world. Although it now has less than 500 inhabitants, it was granted the rank of town in medieval times, which it hasn't lost since then. 
<li>There are several famous carnivals in Wallonia, including Binche, Aalst, Fosse-la-Ville and Malmedy. 
<li>There isn't only one Manneken Pis in Belgium. Apart from the world-famous statue in Brussels, Geraardsbergen has had a similar boy peeing continuously in front of its townhall since the middle of the 15th century. 
<li>1.6 million people in Belgium are immigrants or children or grandchildren or immigrants, i.e 15% of the population, including 280,000 of Italian origin and 240,000 of Moroccan origin. 
<li>A 2007 UNICEF report on child well-being in rich countries ranked Belgium as the best country for children's educational well-being. 
<li>According to a 2007 European Commission report, Belgium has the lowest salary gap between men and women in the EU (after Malta, where proportionally fewer women work).</li></ul>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Belgium has 3 official languages. The North (Flanders) speaks Dutch, the South (Wallonia) speaks French, and a tiny part in the East speaks German (only 0.6% of the total population). People in Brussels, at the center of the country, speak mainly French, Dutch and English. Many Belgians are at least bilingual or trilingual as a consequence. 
French is spoken in southern Belgium because Latin was the official language of the Merovingian and Carolingian courts (respectively based in Tournai and Liege), not for ethnic reasons. Note that Wallonia was never part of France, except for the brief interlude of the French Revolution (but so was most of Europe). </p>
