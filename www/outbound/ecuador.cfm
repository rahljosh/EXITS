<h3>About Ecuador</h3>

<p>Ecuador straddles the equator, from which it takes its name, and has an area of 256,370 square kilometers (98,990 sq mi). Its capital city is Quito, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in the 1970s for having the best preserved and least altered historic center in Latin America.  The country's largest city is Guayaquil. The historic center of Cuenca, the third largest city in the country, was also declared a World Heritage Site in 1999, for being an outstanding example of a planned inland Spanish style colonial city in the Americas . Ecuador is also home—despite its size—to a great variety of species, many of them endemic, like those of the Galápagos islands. This species diversity makes Ecuador one of the seventeen megadiverse countries in the world.  The new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature, or ecosystem rights</p>

<h3>Education in Ecuador</h3>
<p>The educational systems in Ecuador are very strong. Students who fall under the group of five to fourteen, are supposed to attend the school everyday at any cost. To some extent the public education in Ecuador is free. However, according to the ministry of Education in Ecuador, only 10 % of the rural population attends the school level education. On the other hand, about 76 % of the total number of children in Ecuador completes their study till the class six.<br /> <br />
There are total 61 universities in the country of Ecuador. Most of these universities provide the degrees of graduation. The post graduation degrees are also provided by some of the universities. The universities and other educational institutions also provide various types of post-secondary vocational trainings and other types of technical trainings. <br /><br />
In Ecuador education is also available to the lower and disadvantaged classes too. There is no discrimination ion the ground of age, sex and cast in the field education in Ecuador.</p>

<H2>Did You Know...about Ecuador?</h2>
<h3>Ecology & Environment</h3>
<p> Overview: In the Ecuadorian Amazon, which represents just two percent of the whole basin, live one-third of all the bird species in the entire Amazon region, and 10 percent of all the tree species on earth. Over 24 tropical life zones are found in Ecuador (according to the Holdridge Life Zone system) including: mangrove swamp, dry tropical forest, tropical cloud forest, paramo, and tropical lowland rainforest. Due to its great variety of life zones, Ecuador boasts one the highest levels of bio-diversity in the world. For example one hectare of lowland rainforest can contain as many frog species as in all of North America; one tree can contain more ant species than in all of the British Isles combined; and of the world's known bird species (about 9,000), pint-sized Ecuador is home to over 1,500. Ecuador also has one of the greatest levels of endemism anywhere in the world.</p> 

<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Spanish is the official language of the Republic of Ecuador. Even though other languages and dialects are spoken by the different ethnic groups in Ecuador. Among these languages, quechua is the most spoken, it is spoken in the towns of the rocky mountain range and jungle where there is two dialects, quechua of napo and the pastaza quechua. Several small lowland groups speak their own languages. English is understood in the best hotels and in airline offices and travel agencies, but it's of little use elsewhere. </p>
