   <h1>About Us</h1>

<p>We at ISE are proud of our organization. We have designed a company that attempts to put the students, schools, and families above all else. Our goal of bringing people of the world closer together is what motivates our national and regional offices on a daily basis.</p>

<p>We are also very proud of our representatives in the field. They are deeply committed to bringing the message of our foreign exchange program to all of its participants, including our schools and families. We know that we can and do affect change within our ever-shrinking world. The love and care that our families and schools display toward our students are what make our organization successful.</p>

<p>We all know we are involved in a lofty and difficult mission. That is what makes us strive for perfection. The knowledge gained by a homestay and school experience affects everyone. We thank you, our families, schools and International Representatives for helping us make such a wonderful endeavor possible.</p>

<p>All of our programs are carefully designed. We are proud to say that our administration is educationally oriented as teachers and educational administrators make up our national headquarters team. We are fully aware that such important programs require careful planning and organization as well as care, love, and attention.</p>

<p>We know that we can make a difference in this world when we work together for a common goal. To love what you are doing and to be involved in such a special program make all the effort well worth it! ISE was founded in 1982. It is a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing people of the world closer together through student exchange and intercultural education.</p>

<p>ISE accepts highly qualified and well-screened students from over 55 countries around the world.</p>

<p>Based on the materials submitted by ISE and reviewed by the Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET), an independent national educational organization founded in 1984, ISE has been granted a listing every year. In 2009, ASA International, DM Discoveries, and INTO Ed Ventures were merged with ISE. Indicative of its high level of professionalism and respect within the foreign exchange industry, ISE is designated by the Department of State as an official sponsor of the Exchange Visitor Program.</p>

<p>ISE is headquartered on Long Island, 60 minutes from Manhattan. Forty-four fully staffed Regional Offices are strategically located in the United States. ISE cooperates with over 100 independent foreign agencies in over 45 countries around the world for the recruitment and placement of students in American homes.  </p>
