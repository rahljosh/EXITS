      <div class="testimonial">For me, being an exchange student has been a once in a lifetime gift. It helped me to grow and become a stronger person.  I've encountered and learned a lot, and gained a bigger perspective, which made me learn how to handle tough situations and solve problems wisely.  I would like to thank you, my host family, and the director, for making my stay here the best experience that I've had in my life! <br />
