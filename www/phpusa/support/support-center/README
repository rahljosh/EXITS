=====================================================
INSTALLATION
=====================================================

1. Untar the cerberus-support-center-3.x.x.tar.gz file.  This will create a 
directory called 'support-center'.  Move this file into your webserver
path under the web site you want to have the public tool displayed to
your customers.

--

2. Edit the support-center/cerberus-support-center/config.php file and set the
following values:

DB_*  - your database connection details to the cerberus-gui database

SMTP_HOST - the host you'll be sending mail through

PROFILE_ID - the profile ID you set up in the cerberus-gui [Configuration] area
under 'Public GUI Profiles'.

WEB_URL - the browser url to the support-center

--

3. Set the permissions on the support-center files.  You can do this 
recursively on most Unix systems with the following command:

chmod -R a+r support-center/

--

4. You should be all set!  If you open up the support-center/ directory in your
browser, you should be able to browse your public knowledgebase articles from
the Cerberus GUI.


=====================================================
RUNNING IN STANDALONE
=====================================================

If you choose to run the Support Center in standalone mode, meaning it's not 
embedded in one of your existing websites, you can modify the index.php file
included in the support-center/ directory.

Simply move the entire support-center directory into your webserver path 
under any website.


=====================================================
EMBEDDING THE SUPPORT CENTER IN YOUR WEBSITE
=====================================================

WebGroup Media has embeded the Support Center into the Cerberus Helpdesk site:
http://www.cerberusweb.com/support.php

If you'd like to embed the Support Center into your existing website, you'll
need to follow these simple steps.

--

1. Move the 'cerberus-support-center' directory out of 'support-center' and 
into the website where you want to embed the tool.

--

2. Open the 'index.php' file in the 'support-center' directory and find the
three (3) sections marked "COPY:".  They are:

i. The session system include around line 3.
ii. The stylesheet link around line 12.
iii. The Support Center include around line 35.

--

3. You'll need to decide what page on your existing website you want to embed
the Support Center on.  For this example, we'll assume the page is named
support.php

--

4. Add the session system (i) to the top of support.php -- you can simply copy
the entire PHP block from our example index.php file.  Make sure you get 
everything between the php tags: <?php ...(code is here)... ?>

--

5. Move the stylesheet link (ii) into the <HEAD>...</HEAD> html block of the 
support.php page.

-- 

6. Move the Support Center (iii) include into exact position in your 
support.php page's HTML where you want it to be displayed.  It will create a 
770 pixel width table.  If you need to change those dimensions, you can edit
the cerberus-support-center/main.php file.

--

7. Once you've moved i, ii and iii above into your existing website, the 
Support Center should be embedded and operational.

CUSTOMIZING
=====================================================

As with most of WebGroup Media's tools, the Support Center source code has been
provided.  You are free to make any modifications you need, provided you follow
the basic tenets of the Cerberus Public License, which are fairly simple:

- You're free to share changes, but don't encrypt the source.
- You may not sell/share/give-away any components of the Support Center for use
in any capacity outside those which relate directly to Cerberus Helpdesk.

You'll probably want to include your own company logo in the header of the 
Support Center, as well as modify the cerberus-support-center/themes/* 
stylesheet to match your company color scheme.

Happy customizing!
