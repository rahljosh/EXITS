              AYP students who have been accepted into one of the regular AYP programs.
These Pre AYP programs operate during the months of July and August. 
Students can choose their own duration from one week to four weeks. 
Students reside with host families and take up to five hours of intensive 
ESL study from Monday through Friday.<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These programs aim to give each qualified AYP student a head start in 
gaining confidence in speaking and residing with his/her host family.&nbsp; Often 
students fear speaking a second language and need at least a month to feel 
comfortable in speaking in a new language within a new culture.&nbsp; This 
programs offers this opportunity.</P>
