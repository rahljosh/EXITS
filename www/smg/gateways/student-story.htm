                    <span class="style1">Provided by Christine Conte, DMD Regional Manager</span></p>
                  <p align="justify">Charles, a South Korean exchange student living in China, whom I supervised, landed in Indiana late August of last year.  When he got off the plane he didn&rsquo;t smile and I learned shortly thereafter that he rarely spoke.  All the way home he listened to his IPod.  He answered questions when asked (his English was perfect), but I was pretty sure he wasn't going to be one of my successful students. I guess I should have listened to my own theory of don't be so quick to judge someone by first impressions.  The next day I went visit with him in his host family&rsquo;s home and completed his orientation.  He asked many questions, but with a tone of arrogance.  During the year, however, I learned it was not smugness, but rather his systematic, &lsquo;black and white&rsquo; approach to life.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was October 9, 2007 when I realized I had a possible shining star in my midst.  Following a school function, we had the opportunity to converse.  We had a 2-hour conversation that included his views of China and South Korea, as well as his thoughts on the United States.  His were not answers to which I was accustomed.  He was very descriptive in his views of why he enjoys the US, especially Crown Point, Indiana. Before now, Charles had always lived in big cities that never had a sense of community about them.  People did not say, &ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;, or &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; in the cities he knew.  He believes the education system here is by far better than the education in his country.  He also likes the way Americans band together in time of need or celebration.  Charles also respects that Americans regard education with great importance, but appreciates that Americans don't build their lives around it as in his country.  As the months went on, Charles and I developed a strong relationship.  He made every effort to become involved in his school and community . . . he attended plays, football games, high school orchestra and band concerts.  Charles doesn't wait for an invitation, he just goes, welcoming the opportunity to learn more.<br>
                    <br>
                  In mid-March Charles said to me, &quot;I need to show you a letter.  I did something that I hope you won't be mad about.&rdquo;  My heart stopped at the thought of what it might be.  He handed me a letter from Ball State University.  The school was asking him to contact them about being a College Exchange Student in a year and a half.  I was shocked!  I asked him why they sent him this.  He then handed me another piece of paper... a copy of his PSAT test scores.  Another example of not waiting for someone else to &lsquo;invite&rsquo; him or suggest he participate!  Charles then showed me a stack of post cards he received from other colleges who wanted to call on him.<br>
                  <br>
                  Later, his host mother shared with me that Charles is incredibly focused and knows what he wants out of life.  We worked together with Charles to help him reach his goals.  He took every test that might open up doors for him to begin college.  Charles arranged a new schedule with his school in China that was made up of college bound classes.  He was scheduled to leave on June 10, but asked for an extension, so he could take his last two tests necessary to begin the college application process.<br>
                  <br>
                  During a long drive to take Charles for more academic tests, he and I discussed his plan for the next year... and beyond.  I provided him with names and numbers of people at schools across the country, but he has his mind set on Purdue University Engineering School.  We made sure I had all his test scores and any other essential materials, so in the event any school needed information right away, I could provide it.  He shared his Ten-Year-Plan, which included finishing high school, attending college in the United States, interning at an engineering firm, and finally, securing employment in Chicago while living in Crown Point, Indiana.  Because Charles is such a determined young man, I have no doubt he will live out his well-planned course<br>
                  <br>
                  And beyond this, Charles wants to help DMD by hosting exchange students after he is working and established in Crown Point. Charles commented that the program was such an important process for any student who has ever thought about living in the United States and expressed gratitude for his opportunity and the supervision he received... he wants to express that by becoming a host parent!<br>
                  <br>
                  When we arrived at his host family&rsquo;s home following the drive home after the test, Charles said to me, &quot;<em>I am sad to be leaving but I will not say goodbye, just see you next summer&hellip;and I will see you next summer</em>&quot;.  He walked into the house and waved goodbye.   I was so overwhelmed by our experience that I cried.  I realized with all the stress of placing students and working through their problems, it takes just one eager, determined student to show me the true value of what I do... it's all about the students!  However, I also benefit from this job.  I have learned to interact effectively with teenagers, so when my six year old becomes one, hopefully the patience I have learned and the understanding I have gained will help her get through the years of trials and tribulation.  Then, when I&rsquo;m not even expecting it, my daughter will share her Ten-Year-Plan with me. <br>

                    <p align="justify">My family and I chose a delightful young lady from Greenland to host for the  07-08 school year.  August 10th, Rita arrived in Idaho with all my family at the airport to greet her when she stepped off the plane... she was quite surprised by all the people waiting for her. We knew she was the right girl for us!<br>
                      <br>
                      Rita was very nervous about her first day of school and I felt like I was sending my baby off to kindergarten!  She came home and told me about her first day of school and I knew right away that we were supposed to host her.  From the start, our relationship was more than just a host mother and student, we were friends.  If she or I had something on our minds, we knew we could talk to each other.  During holidays, she would lend a hand during events for the students or as a family member for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Christmas time was an especially wonderful time because she was very excited to decorate and get things ready for the big day. <br>
                      <br>
                      Rita was an active skier, skiing competitively in her home country and was missing that part of her life.  Rita and I spoke about her wanting to be able to actively ski while she was here, and because my family doesn&rsquo;t ski, Rita and I decided it would be in her best interest to relocate her with a family who could provide her with the opportunity to ski.  In January, Rita moved in with a new family. Rita and I continued to talk almost everyday, went to lunch together and our relationship stayed strong. <br>
                      <br>
                      On March 2nd, Rita&rsquo;s new host mother called to tell me that Rita had been in a sledding accident and had been airlifted to the hospital . . . my daughter drove me to the hospital immediately.  We were taken right away to see Rita in a trauma room.  She had been told that she had broken something in her back.  The next few days seemed to roll into one long day.  I called to Rita&rsquo;s parents in Greenland to share the awful news of their daughter&rsquo;s accident . . . they arrived two days later. We were together when the doctor explained that Rita had broken her back in three places and she might never walk again. <br>
                      <br>
                      As the time grew closer for Rita to go to Denmark with her parents, I knew the separation would be difficult for me . . . and her.  Rita left with her parents April 24.  That was when I fully realized just how close host families can be with their students.  Rita and I shared a very special bond and we stay in touch with each other.  The good news is that she is regaining some feeling in her legs . . . there is hope. <br>
                      <br>
                      So many of us host families grow close to our &lsquo;children&rsquo; while they live with us.  We share their pain as well as their joy.  I wouldn&rsquo;t trade my time with Rita for anything . . . I&rsquo;m stronger than before, even if a little empty, too.  We faced, along with her parents, a very difficult time together . . . but it was preceded by many wonderful days of sharing and laughing.  Hosting does, indeed, change your life . . . for the better. <br>
