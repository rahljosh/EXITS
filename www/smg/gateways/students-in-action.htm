                          <span class="style1">From a Czech village to Monterey Trail, Marek Slavik's a big hit<br>
                          Submitted by Alison Schofield, ISE West Region</span> </p>
                          <p align="justify">Following is an excerpt from an article was written by Joe Davisdon, Sacramento Bee<br>
                            <br>
                          At some point, coaches dream it.<br>
                          <br>
                          What if &hellip; the unexpected happens, and out of the blue a great athlete walks into the program? No fanfare or competition for his services, just somebody no one knew about who can really play.
                            But it was no dream for Kingsley Claudy, boys volleyball coach at Monterey Trail High School. Last fall, one of the school's top players, Johnathan Nguyen, sprinted up to the coach and said in so many words a volleyball star had arrived, special delivery from the Czech Republic. Name of Marek Slavik. Mad skills.<br>
                          Claudy asked Slavik, a 6-foot-4 exchange student from the village of Rosovice, to hit a few volleyballs. The 18-year-old obliterated them as onlookers ducked for cover.<br>
                          <br>
                          &quot;Right away, you can tell he was a special player, an amazing athlete,&quot; Claudy said. &quot;He was the complete package. Just dominating.&quot;  Slavik's impact on the Mustangs has been profound. The team was 17-15 last season and has improved to 20-7 so far this season.<br>
                          <br>
                          Slavik said he came to the United States to experience American culture and to prepare for a career as an automobile engineer. Choosing Elk Grove, Slavik said he wanted to hone his English skills and see as many cars as possible.  &quot;I came mostly to learn more English,&quot; Slavik said. &quot;English speaking in Europe has great value for jobs. I also wanted to learn more about the American economy, and to see what school was like here.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Volleyball helped Slavik's transition from resident of a village with about 350 people to American student at a high school with more than 2,000.  Slavik, who loves cars and talking, has become the team's social epicenter. He augments his skills in athletics and socializing with honor-level grades and said he is fascinated by the Declaration of Independence.<br>
                          <br>
                          He also noted the differences between playing volleyball in high school and playing it as a club sport in the Czech Republic.  &quot;I love this team here. It's so different than back home,&quot; Slavik said. &quot;Here, it's a team &ndash; no egos, no attitude. Just good guys and a lot of fun.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Slavik lives with Brad and Dawn Hall, both of whom work in retail computer software.  &quot;We feel very lucky,&quot; Dawn Hall said. &quot;It's been a wonderful experience. He has a great sense of humor.&quot;<br>
                          <br>
                          Slavik's English has improved dramatically, and Claudy said he also has learned &quot;a lot of American slang.&quot; It's &quot;oh, my gosh&quot; one moment and &quot;my bad&quot; another.<br>
                          <br>
                          Slavik said he is torn about returning to his parents &ndash; his father is a manager for a book company, his mother a physical therapist &ndash; three younger brothers, fishing and his beloved motorcycle.<br>
&quot;I have mixed feelings,&quot; Slavik said. &quot;I have the same feelings as I did before I came here. I don't want to leave friends and family behind, but I was excited about the opportunity. Now I don't want to leave my friends here and (the Halls).<br>
<br>
&quot;But I am also excited to go home.&quot;</p>

</span>Provided by Mary Miller, ISE Mid-Central Regional Director</p>                        <p align="justify">The familiar phrase, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as American as apple pie&rdquo; is quite appropriate for an exchange student living in Jennison, Michigan.  Matteus Hamade, a student from Brazil, worked with his host mom at their local church on a project that has world-wide impact.<br>
  <br>
  A local church mission group works to raise funds for those in need and to help cover the expenses associated with mission trips.  This past October, the group prepared 1,500 apple pies from scratch!  If there are only two apples in each pie, that is 3,000 apples that were peeled, cored and sliced!   Matteus and his host mom, Sherri Meyer gave their time to this effort.<br>
  <br>
  A very significant connection for Matteus is knowing that a portion of the funds raised from the sale of the pies was sent to his home country of Brazil to help those in great need!  This is a wonderful example of one way H.E.L.P. is not only effective locally, but, indeed, it benefits those far beyond the borders of our communities.</p>
