        In an effort to keep you all more up-to-date as changes are rolled out in EXITS, a weekly newsletter will be sent out listing any changes made to EXITS.  All changes will be rolled out between Friday 15:00 and Sunday 23:00 so that they are live by Monday morning. (Unless an immediate action is required.) The newsletter explaining the changes will be sent during the same time frame.  While attempts are made to fully test new features before they are rolled live, there will inevitably be the occasional error that was not caught. </Td>
