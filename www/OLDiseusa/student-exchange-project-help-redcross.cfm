<h3 style="padding-top: 15px;">3. Activity Guides</h3>
<p>The Red Cross has developed fun activity guides for youths to use to help spread the word about the Red Cross and its mission to prevent and alleviate human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors. Activity Guides can be used by Red Cross Clubs, youth groups or classes who want to organize Red Cross mission-related activities.</p>
<p>These Activity Guides will help you lead and implement Red Cross projects. No matter what activity you choose, get in touch with your <a href="http://www.redcross.org/find-your-local-chapter">local Red Cross unit</a>. The Red Cross can provide you with helpful resources and guidelines to make your activity a success!</p>
You can find more activities to help your community get prepared on <a href="http://redcrossyouth.org/">RedCrossYouth.org</a>.

    <div class="clearfixPH"></div>
  
<div class="column1">
  <p>The humanitarian mission of the American Red Cross connects us to people and communities across the nation and around the world. The common bonds of humanity and compassion unite us together, not just in the face of emergencies and disasters, but in helping our neighbors every day.<strong> </strong></p>
  <p>Since being founded by Clara Barton in 1881, the Red Cross has been a consistent lifeline for people when they need us the most. The depth and breadth of our services&#8212;whenever and wherever they're called for&#8212;is unmatched by any organization in the world.</p>
  <p>These extraordinary efforts are made possible by our supporters, donors and volunteers who roll up their sleeves and open their hearts to help their neighbors&#8212;by giving time, money and blood, or by taking a course to learn CPR, first aid or other essential skills. Our volunteers and contributors make a difference in millions of lives each year.</p>
