                            Hotel rooms are (Quad) 4 students assigned to a room &ndash; all same gender. If you request a friend, host brother or host 
                            sister (of high school age 15-19 of same gender) you can be assigned together if you request early enough when signing up 
                            for a tour. Just complete this request on your permission form online and mail out completed form to MPD Tour America, Inc. 
                            Also, a lot of students do not know anyone before tour begins, but everyone makes a lot of new friends.

                            Most airline tickets are non-refundable, which means that you will not get a refund for the ticket if you do not travel. 
                            Most airlines will allow you to use the value of ticket to purchase another ticket later but they will charge a fee to change the ticket, 
                            which is usually is approximately $100.00 fee
