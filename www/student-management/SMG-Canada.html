			<p>SMG Canada has one primary goal, to offer each student a program that fits all of his or her needs and fulfills all of his or her dreams. Our students are guaranteed every opportunity to succeed socially and academically. We accommodate students from start to finish. Some are just starting their academic career. Others are looking for one last year to perfect their resume before moving on to University. SMG Canada strives to offer every option to every student. We offer a fully customizable program, meeting the expectations of students and parents alike. </p>

			<h3 style="color:#900f1c"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> Who would benefit from and enjoy an academic program in Canada?</h3>
			
			<img src="images/smg-canada/photo1.png" align="left" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #999; background-color:#fff;-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #888; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 5px#888; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #888; margin:15px 30px 20px 5px" />

			<p>Almost any student would enjoy spending time in one of our 70+ schools, spread throughout the many provinces of Canada. SMG Canada accepts students from the early age of 11 up until graduation at age 19. Younger students benefit greatly from attending an academic year abroad. This opportunity sets them on a path for success, regardless of where they continue their education. Older students enjoy finishing their High School career in Canada and receiving endless amounts of support while they apply to one of the thousands of Universities and Colleges spread throughout North America. Our schools offer ESL and language support for any level of English.  We offer students varying levels of education that include AP courses, Honors courses, IB credits, and almost any other class a student may desire. The same concept is valid for sports. SMG Canada partners with top performing districts that regularly send students on to become professional athletes. Almost any sport or activity can also be offered at a recreational level.  </p>

			<h3 style="color:#900f1c"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> When does the program begin?</h3>
			<p>SMG Canada can accept students at any time throughout the year. We always have an option to offer an enthusiastic and willing student. Typically, programs start in September and January lasting 5,10 or 12 months. Students can arrive at any time of the year though. We also offer short-term programs for students that want a chance to experience education and cultural learning during a break from their classes at home. Many times our students that enroll in a short-term program end up staying the entire year! Students can also stay through the summer or return home and come back next semester. </p>

			<h3 style="color:#900f1c"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> Where do you dream of spending your next academic year? </h3>

			<p>Canada is a place where dreams are fulfilled. Whether you love the outdoors or enjoy the city life, we have a community for you. Our schools boast low international enrollment and range from 300-1500 Canadian students. Regardless of school size, our international students become instant celebrities in all of our districts. Canada boasts one of the best education systems in the world along with one of the lowest crime rates across the globe. </p>

			<hr style="margin:20px " />

			<h3 style="color:#900f1c"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> Why should you choose our program?</h3>

			<img src="http://www.smg-canada.org/images/kids.jpg" align="left" style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #999; background-color:#fff;-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 5px #888; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 5px#888; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #888; margin:15px 40px 20px 10px" />

			<p>Students typically choose our program for one reason, flexibility. We allow our students to choose the district and high school they want.</p>
			
			
			<p>More so, we want to know what type of host family each student will enjoy living with. Have you always dreamed of having an older brother or a younger sister? Maybe you always wanted to live on a horse ranch? Students can even request a home with or with out pets. We have one of the lowest rates of relocation in all of international education. This is because we have great families that are precisely matched with student requests.</p>

			<p>Many of our students choose Canada because they want to play a sport either recreationally or professionally. Our districts are located close to some of the most famous Ski resorts in the world and host some of the top hockey teams in the NHL. Other students want to speak another language. Our districts offer over more than 10 choices to learn a second language.</p>

			<p>Academics are one of the most important items for some students. Canada can offer a challenge for any student in any of their favorite subjects. Many of our students receive diplomas each year. Our schools also offer College and University enrollment assistance. Some even have personal connections to the local Colleges and Universities guaranteeing a student acceptance if they follow the school recommendations. For students that plan to return home, our schools are very experienced with preparing and validating transcripts. This service is also included in our program.</p>

			<p>A major benefit of our program is the ability for parents to visit and students to travel home, anytime of the year. On top of all these benefits, we offer emergency assistance 24 hours a day. A local rep or school administrator is only a phone call away, regardless what time it is.</p>

			<hr style="margin:20px " />

			<h3 style="color:#900f1c"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> How do you apply?</h3>
			<p>All of our applications are available and easily submitted through our online database.<br />
