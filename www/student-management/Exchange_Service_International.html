			<h3 style="color:#1e3fa2"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> Who Can Apply to the F-1 Public High School Program?</h3>
			<p>Students applying to the F-1 Public High School Program must be between the ages of 14 and 18 years old.  Students must have completed 8th grade prior to arrival.

			<h3 style="color:#1e3fa2"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> What Types of Programs are Offered?</h3>
			<p>Students can apply to the F-1 Public High School Program for a semester, an academic year or a calendar year, with both August and January start dates available.  Students are primarily placed in host families, who have been thoroughly screened and selected by Exchange Service International.  All families participating in the ESI program are paid families who are interested in opening their homes and sharing their lives with a teenager from abroad. These families understand the value of cultural exchange and the positive message that hosting an international student can bring to a local community. Select public school districts do offer boarding facilities as well.</p>

			<h3 style="color:#1e3fa2"><img src="images/arrow.png" /> When Can Students Apply?</h3>
			<p>The F-1 Public School Program offers rolling admission, however certain districts fill up fast so it is best to get applications in early to ensure first choice district.  Please note that the student applies to a school district, not a particular high school.  The district will then decide which high school best suits the student.</p>
