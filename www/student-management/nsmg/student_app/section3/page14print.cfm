I agree to assume financial responsibility for all expenses of such care. 
</p>
<p>
I also understand that certain vaccinations may be required for the Exchange Student to participate in certain schools and that the vaccination requirements vary across each state in the United States. If the documentation of these vaccinations has not been included in the student application submitted to #CLIENT.companyShort#, I authorize the Designated Adults to have the required vaccines administered to the Exchange Student. I agree to assume financial responsibility for all expenses related to the administration of these vaccines. 
</p>

It is understood that this authorization is given in advance of any such medical treatment, but is given to provide authority and power on the part of the Designated Adult in the exercise of his or her best judgment upon the advice of any such medical or emergency personnel.
