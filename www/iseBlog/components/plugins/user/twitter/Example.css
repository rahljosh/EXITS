/* 
Since twitter updates are put into place by javascript it may be difficult 
to see what the generated elements are. Viewing Source will not show you 
everything that there is to see. Here I have compiled the more commonly needed
id and classes so that you can style your twitter badge any way you like. If
you use the Firebug extension for Firefox  you cna inspect the display item to 
see other classes not listed here.
