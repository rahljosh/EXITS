<p class="paragraphText">The Town of Granby is a rural suburban town on the outskirts of the Holyoke
metropolitan area, approximately 20 minutes from Springfield, MA and 30 minutes from Bradley International Airport in Hartford, MA.  Granby is centrally located near several prestigious colleges, including Mt. Holyoke College, Amherst College, Hampshire College and Smith College.  Settled around 1727, the town is dominated in the north by the Holyoke range of hills and has a rugged terrain which hampered agricultural development as the limited water resources hampered industrial development.  However, despite these obstacles, settlers developed farms and some limited industries which made up the town's economic foundation. They grew grains, turnips, pumpkins and hops, and small distilleries were open by 1812 using the surplus grain produced.  Dairy farming, making buttons and palm leaf hats followed these in economic importance in the 19th century.<br /><br />                                                              
However, by 1875, local industry was gone and agriculture, primarily dairy farming, was the staple in Granby.  The town still retains the huge, well-known milk bottle which houses a dairy bar. Granby retains its original meeting house green and the period character that this section of town gives it as well as a fine neoclassical library and a good stock of Greek revival houses.</p><br /><br />
