 <h1 class="newsA"> MacDuffie School to Be Acquired;
    <br />
    Move to New Granby Campus</h1>
  
<p><strong>Springfield, MA&#8212;</strong> Representatives of The MacDuffie School in Springfield today announced the planned sale of all school operations, not including the school's Springfield real estate, to International EC LLC, the group that acquired the former St. Hyacinth seminary campus in Granby in June. </p>

<p>International EC is establishing an independent school in Granby and will absorb MacDuffie's curriculum, corporate identity, intellectual property, furnishings, computers and business equipment and faculty as it establishes a school serving grades 6 through 12 beginning in the fall of 2011. The school will continue as a day and boarding school.</p>

<p>Massachusetts Attorney General approval is needed since the sale involves a non-profit entity, The MacDuffie School, being acquired by a privately held company, International EC. Michael A. Serafino, Chairman of The MacDuffie School Board of Trustees made the following statement regarding the sale:</p>

<p>"The acquisition of MacDuffie by International EC LLC represents an exciting new chapter in MacDuffie's history, offering our student body a larger campus with enhanced classroom space, outstanding boarding facilities, state-of-the-art technology and athletic fields in a college preparatory environment with high academic standards.</p>

<p>"In the highly competitive academic marketplace for private middle and secondary schools, this move represents a chance to expand and promote the MacDuffie brand and mission in a way that our current location, with space and infrastructure limitations, would not allow. </p>


<p>"We feel this move will make the MacDuffie name more attractive to prospective domestic and international students, effectively merging our 120 year reputation for educational excellence with an organization with experience in working with international secondary students. The strengths of these two organizations will be merged on an attractive 26-acre rural campus that is also currently undergoing extensive renovations.</p>

<p>"This transaction requires the review and approval of the Massachusetts Attorney General, and that process is now underway. The MacDuffie Board of Directors has concluded that sale of the school is in MacDuffie's best interest. We are hopeful that the Attorney General will find that it is also in the public interest and that MacDuffie's educational mission will continue well into the future. </p>

<p>"As competition in private secondary education has increased, it became clear to MacDuffie's leadership that steps needed to be undertaken to remain viable. This move to a spacious new campus, we believe, will enhance the attractiveness of MacDuffie's curriculum and reputation to prospective new students, and to our existing student body as well. The affiliation with International EC will allow us jointly to build upon our school's 120-year reputation for producing well-educated and productive citizens prepared to succeed in a highly competitive world.</p>

<p>"The sale of assets does not include our campus located off of Maple Street and MacDuffie's leadership is very cognizant of our responsibility to develop a plan for the reuse of the property. With this in mind, MacDuffie's Board of Trustees has created a workgroup to ensure that the campus is maintained and secured after the school's operations are moved to Granby. Efforts to prepare the campus for sale will start immediately. The Board's workgroup includes individuals familiar with the local and regional real estate market. </p>

<p>"We will also initiate a vigorous communications plan to inform our current student body, their parents, prospective new students, staff, alumni, vendors and representatives of the City of Springfield about the acquisition and the planned move to Granby. Springfield has represented a wonderful host community for MacDuffie for over a century and we look forward to working with the City in identifying an appropriate re-use of the property."</p>

<p>   International EC, LLC has three managing partners:  Craig Brewer, who currently oversees a large private high school program for international students in the United States; Wayne Brewer, who is currently the CEO of International Student Exchange; and, Dal Swain, the owner and President of FLS, which has a network of ESL schools for foreign students. Wayne Brewer represented International EC at the press conference.</p>
