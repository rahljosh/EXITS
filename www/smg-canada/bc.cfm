  <h2> Districts</h2>
<h4>Central Okanagan School District</h4>
<p>The Central Okanagan School District is located in the south central mountains of British Columbia. With a population of over 160,000 the Okanagan valley is one of the most populated regions in British Columbia. This area is famous for its wineries, orchards, golf courses, and ski resorts which all contribute to its number one industry, tourism. Okanagan Lake is ideally located in a valley of the central mountains which are famous for winter activities such as skiing and snowboarding. The central Okanagan is considered one of the best places to live in Canada as the lake regulates the climate keeping the valley relatively temperate. The winters are short and mild with the temperature rarely falling below freezing while the summers are long and remain quite warm. This district offers specialized academies which allow students to earn credits while learning and practicing their favorite sports.</p>
