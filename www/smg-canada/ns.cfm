  <h2> Districts</h2>
<h4>Nova Scotia Public School District</h4>
<p>Nova Scotia is known as one of the friendliest places on earth.  Its history is vibrant and culture rich. Nova Scotia is located along Canada's Atlantic coast. Therefore the sea plays a major role in the almost every aspect of Nov Scotia's culture.  It also offers a wealth of activities from sailing, surfing, and swimming; to hiking, biking, and golfing. Nova Scotia's indigenous Algonquian people had been living off the area's bountiful waters for thousands of years before the first European explorers began their navigation and exploration. With a population of over 940,000, Nova Scotia is able to offer some extraordinary programs to their residents. The capital city is Halifax which acts as the economic hub of the region.  With its endless list of opportunities and attractions, Nova Scotia makes a great place for any student to spend an academic year. <br /><br />
  Nova Scotia is a safe, clean province with one of the best health care systems in the world. The Nova Scotia International Student Program is committed to providing an excellent education and home stay environment to all international students. Students are given the opportunity to choose from a variety of subjects focusing on arts, sciences, languages, and computers. The subjects are taught under the careful supervision of certified teachers. All schools follow curriculum set by the provincial government. Students can also choose from a variety of extracurricular activities such as soccer, volleyball, basketball, curling, skiing, and creative art just to name a few.<br /><br />
  The International Student Program in Nova Scotia is quite unique compared to the programs offered in other Canadian provinces. This program consists of a consortium of the seven regional English speaking school boards in Nova Scotia. As with all of our programs, students are placed in a high school within the district and live with a host family for the length of their program. However, the Nova Scotia program chooses the school and community for each student based upon the academic and extra-curricular schedule they would like to follow. Although some students may be concerned by this, we can assure you that each and every school and community is of high quality and will provide a great experience. They work with over 90 schools throughout the province and all schools follow the same curriculum as set by the provincial Department of Education. </p>
