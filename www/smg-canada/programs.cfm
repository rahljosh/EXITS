 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian School Districts have proven to be quite flexible in many different ways.  This enables SMG to offer academic programs that can fit the needs of any student.  We are able to offer programs for as little as one week but students can also spend their entire academic career in Canadian schools.  Graduation is absolutely achievable as long as the student fulfills all required courses.  Co-validation or grade conversions are also available for students that require this.  For most programs, we suggest that students arrive within two weeks of the start of school and depart within two weeks of the end of school. </p>

<h4>Academic Year Program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our most popular program is one in which students arrive in Canada for the beginning of the school year and stay for ten months.  Each student is assigned his or her own host family to live with and attends a local school on a regular basis. Departure is normally sometime in May or June and is at the discretion of both the student and the host family. </p>

<h4>Academic Semester Program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some students know what they want right away, others can be quite hesitant to commit.  Many students chose to come for just one semester for a variety of reasons.  It may work out better with his or her school schedule or the student may be hesitant to spend an entire year abroad. In either case, our Academic Semester program is a great choice. Students are able to arrive in either August or January and spend approximately five months in Canada.  Students who choose to participate in this program quite often choose to extend their program for a second semester.  Extension is available in most school districts. </p>

<h4>Twelve Month Program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In certain parts of the world the academic year starts in January.  We have created a unique program for students in these regions. Our Twelve Month Program starts in January and continues through the following December. This provides students with the opportunity to spend an academic year abroad while still staying on track with the academic schedule of their native country.  During the summer, students can either return home for a couple months or enjoy some recreational time in Canada.</p>

<h4>Short Term Program</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times students are not sure if they would like to commit to an entire school year or even a semester for that matter. Other students just don't have the resources to spend a long time away from home.  That is why we have developed our Short Term Program.  We are able to offer students almost any program variation they desire.  Individual students can come for as short as three weeks.  They may choose full immersion (a full day academic schedule) or partial immersion (half day academic schedule split with ESL or recreation).  Students may choose particular classes and activities they wish to participate in.  Extensions are almost always available.  We can also cater to groups for short term programs. These students can come for as little as one week but the group must have a minimum of 15 students.  <span class="redText">Almost any reasonable request can be fulfilled so please feel free to ask for if there is anything you don't see that may be of interest to you. </span></p>
