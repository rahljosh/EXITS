<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Management Group (SMG) has been offering students the opportunity to study in Canada since 2006. Through our partners in Canada, we are able to offer an exceptional opportunity for international students to become part of a new family, study at a new school, and learn about an entirely new culture.  Each student is given the opportunity to create a program that is customized to their liking by choosing the school they attend, classes they take, activities and sports they participate in, and length of their program.  While living with a loving and caring Host Family, students will attend the local school and integrate with other Canadian students on a daily basis.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here at SMG, we pride ourselves on the superior level of quality that our programs offer.  Each and every school district we partner with offers an exceptional program.  From the high ranking education to the close knit communities, every detail has been covered. Students are provided an opportunity to learn in all types of communities ranging from big cities to rural farms and everywhere in between. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's Education system ranks among some of the best in the world. While each district has its own unique advantages, every school offers a large variety of both core and elective classes.  Almost every school offers the opportunity to choose from a wide variety of elective classes ranging from Art, Dance and Music to Computer technology, Web Design and programming.  Many Schools also offer specific academies specializing in sports like Hockey and Baseball or career based hobbies such as Mechanical Services and Culinary Arts. </p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Host families are carefully chosen and students are closely matched to families with similar interests and hobbies.  Host family coordinators help to manage the relationship with the student and their family. While problems are extremely rare, the coordinator is always there to supervise the student and counsel both the family and student if an issue does arise. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Student Management Group offers its knowledge and experience from start to finish. We begin by helping the students choose a program that's right for them.  As they continue on with their dream, we insure that the program is a success by coordinating with and facilitating all interaction between the student's agency and family back in their home country, as well as between the school and host family in Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our goal to provide each and every student with a program that fits both their wants and needs. SMG strives to offer every option to every student. We have done our best to create a fully customizable program that fulfills the hopes and dreams of any student. We understand that spending any amount of time in a foreign environment can be a challenge for anyone and we are here to help you succeed at that challenge and enjoy yourself while doing it!
