  <h1>British Columbia</h1>
    <p>British Columbia is populated with about four and a half million people and located along Canada's western coast. It is bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the west and the world famous Rocky Mountains in the east.  Breathtaking landscapes and amazing views set British Columbia apart from the other provinces in Canada.  Its geographical diversity creates an immense assortment of activities and adventures. There are mountains to climb, snowy peaks to ski, beaches to enjoy, forests to hike, parks to explore and warm summer lakes to laze about on. One of British Columbia's most attractive characteristics is its climate. The summers are warm and the winters are mild. However, the mountains are covered in snow for the extent of the winter season. Although British Columbia was already famous for its world-class ski terrain, the 2010 Olympic Games placed Vancouver at the top of the list for many winter athletes. </p><br />
