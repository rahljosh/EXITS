<p>"Having my long-term career goals in my mind, I have decided to take part in this program. Upon my arrival, I was both anxious and nervous about how my experience in the US would be. But everything  went   far  beyond my expectations!

 I was given the OPPORTUNITY: the opportunity to learn, to experience, to challenge, to grow and to look forward to the future. It is more than a practical professional experience, it is a life experience. So I find myself, from both professional and personal points of view, ready to make our world better! My training experience? A dream come true!"
