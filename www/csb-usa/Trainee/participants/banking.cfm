<h2>Banking / Money Transfers</h2>
<h3>Banking</h3>
<p>Even if you have secured a paid training position it may take 2-5 weeks to obtain a Social Security number and register for payroll at your host company. Therefore, we urge you to bring some cash as well as an international credit or debit card when you depart your country. The most accepted credit card types in the U.S. are:</p>
<ul>
<li>American Express</li>
<li>Visa/Visa Electron</li>
<li>Maestro</li>
<li>MasterCard</li>
<li>Discover</li></ul>

<p>We advise you to open a bank account in the U.S., especially if you are on a paid training in the US. With a bank account in the U.S you can set up a direct deposit of your earnings, easily access and manage your statements online, cash your checks at local bank branches and withdraw money from Automated Teller Machines (ATM).</p>

<p>To open a bank account, bring the following documents with you to the bank*:<br />
<ul>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Social Security Card</li>
<li>ISE Sponsorship Letter</li>
<li>Official Lease or mail addressed to your housing address with your name on it (electricity bill, telephone bill, etc.)</li>
<li>Employment verification letter</li>
<li>- some banks might require your DS2019 and I-94 forms. So, you might bring them as well just in case.</li></ul>
<p>There are 2 bank account types which are commonly available in U.S. banks:</p>
<h5>Checking account:</h5><p> By opening a checking account you can easily deposit and withdraw money from your account via a debit card that is linked to your checking account.  You can also write checks directly from this account. With a debit card you have access to your account 24 hours a day via ATM machines and can make purchases at all the locations that accept debit card payments. In addition, overdraft protection can be added to your checking account.  This service allows the bank to loan your account money to cover any attempt to withdraw money from an account that does not have sufficient funds.</em></p>
<h5>Savings account:</h5>
<p>The basic difference between savings and checking accounts is that savings accounts tend to earn higher interest rates but are not readily accessible. Please note that savings accounts not only earn interest at different rates, but also usually have fees and allow only a certain number of transactions per month against the account. Savings accounts are more limited accounts and you should keep this in mind when choosing what type of bank account to open.</p>
<h5>Credit Cards</h5>
<p>When you pay via debit card, the money is taken instantly and directly from your checking or savings account. When you pay by credit card, your credit card bank or other financial institution pays the bill and sends you a monthly bill for your charges. Using a debit card can help you avoid getting into debt and incurring finance charges, because you pay as you purchase and never accrue a balance owing interest.</p>
<p>We suggest that you bring a credit card from your home country since applying for a credit card in the U.S. is very difficult for trainees. Although having a credit card is convenient to make purchases in the US, it requires a lot of responsibility from a credit card holder since credit cards often charge a high interest rate on outstanding balances. </p>

<h3>Money Transfer:</h3>

<h5>Money Transfer:</h5>
<p>In case you urgently need to receive or send money anywhere in the world during your training we suggest using Western Union money transfer services. You can call 1-800-325-6000 or visit www.westernunion.com to locate the nearest Western Union office and receive or send funds worldwide in an instant.</p> 

<h5>International Wire Transfer: </h5>
<p>Electronic transfer of currency funds is a safe and efficient method of sending and receiving currency payments to or from other countries. Typically money is wired to large partner banks where the recipient can claim it. This service may take up to 7 business days and requires that you have a bank account at the receiving bank. We advise you to visit your international bank branch in the U.S. or other local banks in your area to inquire about the bank-to-bank wire transfer procedures.  Be sure to research all fees associated with this service from both sending and receiving banks.</p>

<h5>International Drafts:</h5> 
<p>International Drafts are an accepted payment practice throughout the world. They are available in more than 200 currencies. You can purchase International Drafts and ask your bank to send it via expedited mail service. It can take anywhere from 2 - 20 days for the beneficiary to receive the payment. The beneficiary may also experience delays in accessing funds after depositing the Draft into their bank account.</p>

<h5>Traveler's Checks:</h5> 
<p>Traveler's checks can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, so they are a convenient and safe substitute for cash. Traveler's checks do not expire and unused traveler's checks can be kept by the purchaser as long as he/she wishes until he/she is ready to spend the money. You can purchase the checks at most U.S. banks. The largest issuing banks of traveler's checks are American Express and Thomas Cook. For your convenience, purchase checks in small denominations and make a separate list of check numbers to keep track of your spending. </p>
