<h5>How far in advance should I apply for internships?</h5>

If you are not currently enrolled in a college or university, we suggest you begin searching for your internship at least 3 to 6 months before you plan to come to the USA to start an internship.</p></div>

If you would like CSB to be your sponsor, you can apply online for the DS 2019. After you obtain your DS 2019, you can schedule your J1 visa interview at the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.
