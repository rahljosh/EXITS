    <h3 class="hTags">Who is CSB International, Inc.?</h3>
<p>Founded in 1997, CSB International, Inc. (CSB) is a cultural exchange organization designated by the United States Department of State as a sponsor for the J-1 Summer Work Travel and Trainee Exchange Visitor Programs. This allows us to offer cross-cultural activities that will expose our program participants to the American society, culture and institutions while abetting them to share their own language, culture and history with the American people. <br /><br />
Our mission is to encourage the development of mutual awareness, respect, concern and trust among people from different nations. What a great goal to have as our standard of operation in bringing people from the world close together. </p><br />
