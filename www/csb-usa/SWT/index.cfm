<p>CSB is designated by the United States Department of State as a sponsor of the J-1 Summer Work Travel Program (SWT). The program allows full-time foreign university students to live, work and travel in the United States for a maximum period of 4 months, but within the limits of their official summer vacation from school.  All participants will have the unique, yet dynamic opportunity to experience the daily life in the United States by sharing its work environment, tradition and culture though short-term work opportunities, an experience that is without a doubt very different from that of a tourist. The CSB team is devoted to help start an American summer adventure: one dream at the time.<br /><br />

The program is also open to hundreds United States based business who wish to offer a unique answer to their seasonal or peak staffing needs. The SWT Program matches highly motivated international university students eager to become a part of an American host site team, with businesses across the United States who have the ability to hire extra staff and enrich their work environment.<br /><br />
