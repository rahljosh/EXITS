<h3 class="hTags">Employers</h3>
<p>CSB is constantly searching for new employers who are interested in diversifying their work force, while at the same time helping to enrich the lives of young, international students with a great cultural experience. CSB places the Summer Work Travel Program participants in host sites in many areas within the United States. The positions must be basic skills/general or entry-level in nature. We do ask that all employers also arrange housing for all participants that they accept. This housing does not need to be employer owed and can be independently owned and operated.  Housing does need to be safe, comfortable and furnished.  All housing facilities must also be approved by CSB.<br /><br />
