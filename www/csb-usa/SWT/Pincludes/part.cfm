<h2>Becoming a Participant</h2>
<p>Please know that we are here to assist with any questions or concerns regarding your program, your documents and/or your official status in the United States. We are committed to making your experience memorable and enjoyable. </p>
<p>It is important that you contact our office if you are thinking of changing your host company. Prior to transferring you to another location, CSB will contact (and in certain instances visit) your new host organization. Additionally, we will need to receive a new training plan and a number of additional documents from the new host company.</p>
<p>
Please also let us know if your housing address changes and if you decide to leave the program early. We want to make sure that your J-1 record remains up-to-date so that you never experience complications in applying for US visas in the future</p></div>
