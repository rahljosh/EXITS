<p>Make a difference in your business by culturally enriching your work environment. Meet your staffing needs with enthusiastic exchange visitors, participants in the Summer Work Travel Program. </p>
<p>The Summer Work Travel allows full-time students at an overseas post-secondary (college or university) accredited institutions the opportunity to live, work and travel in the United States during their official university summer vacation, up to a maximum of 4 (four) months. All the participants will have the opportunity to experience life in the United States by sharing in its tradition and culture through work opportunities, an experience that is very different from that of a tourist. </p>
<p>Participants obtain the J-1 visa from the US Consulate in their home country, based on specific documentation that also includes Form DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor (J-1) Status), which identifies CSB as the United States Department of State sponsor, it defines the purpose of the program and it states the program period, which is the time they can legally work in the United States. </p>
<p>Our goal is to develop and promote a diverse cultural exchange program that ultimately is translated into a personalized experience for the program participants and their American host sites, from the moment they apply for the program, during the program and until the program is completed. </p>
