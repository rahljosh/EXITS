<h3>Becker Paces H-ton with Pair of Goals</h3>
<p class="smSize">Posted: September 30, 2013 3:45 PM </p>
<p>German exchange student TJ Becker scored two second-half goals in his first varsity game in a Huntington High School boys' soccer team uniform to lead the Blue Devils past visiting West Babylon, 3-0.</p>

<p>Huntington has struggled to score this fall, dropping two games by identical 1-0 scores and tying three others, including two scoreless contests and a third that saw the teams knotted at 1-1.</p>

<p>"We have definitely been struggling thus far, however it looks like things are changing," said senior Lee Reiver, the Blue Devils' magnificent goalkeeper. "The addition of TJ and the fact that we scored three [goals] today will help our skill and confidence. Our coaches are getting us to move the ball around more quickly in order to present ourselves with better scoring chances. Our schedule is also getting easier after three tough games so hopefully our scorers will begin to execute."</p>
