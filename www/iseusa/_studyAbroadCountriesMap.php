<p>Argentina's continental area is between the Andes mountain range in the west and the Atlantic Ocean in the east. It borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south. Argentine claims over Antarctica, overlapping claims made by Chile and the United Kingdom, are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty of 1961. Argentina also claims the Falkland Islands (Spanish: Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which are administered by the United Kingdom as British Overseas Territories.</p>
<p>Argentina is a founding member of both the United Nations and the Union of South American Nations. Argentina is one of the G-20 major economies.</p>

<h3>Education in Argentina</h3>
<p>Secondary education in Argentina is called Polimodal (&quot;polymodal&quot;, that is, having multiple modes), since it allows the student to choose his/her orientation. Polimodal is not yet obligatory but its completion is a requirement to enter colleges across the nation. Polimodal is usually 3 years of schooling, although some schools have a fourth year.</p>
<p>Conversely to what happened on primary schools, most secondary schools in Argentina contained grades 8th and 9th, plus Polimodal (old secondary) but then started converting to accept also 7th grade students, thus allowing them to keep their same classmates for the whole EGB III cycle.</p>
<p>Argentina's network of vocational schools, many under the auspices of the National Technological University (UTN), have historically given students viable alternatives, as well.</p>

<h1>About Australia</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<div class="ImgR" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/outbound/australia1.png" width="253" height="294" /></div>
<p>Australia is a prosperous developed country, with a multicultural society. It ranks highly in many international comparisons of national performance such as human development, quality of life, health care, life expectancy, public education, economic freedom and the protection of civil liberties and political rights. Australian cities rank among the world's highest in terms of cultural offerings and quality of life. It is a member of the United Nations, G20, Commonwealth of Nations, OECD, APEC, Pacific Islands Forum and the World Trade Organization.</p>

<h3>Education in Australia</h3>
<p>Education is compulsory in Australia between the ages of five and fifteen to seventeen, depending on the state or territory, and date of birth.  In recent years, over three quarters of students stay at school until they are seventeen. Government schools educate about two thirds of Australian students, with the other third in Catholic and Independent schools. A small portion of students are legally home-schooled.</p>
<p>Government schools generally charge small fees incurring minor administrative costs, while Catholic and Independent schools charge larger fees. Regardless of whether a school is part of the Government, Catholic or Independent systems, they are required to adhere to the same curriculum frameworks of their state or territory. Most school students wear uniforms,  although there are varying expectations and some Australian schools do not require uniforms.</p>

   <h1>About Austria</h1>
   <div class="blueLine"></div>
<div class="ImgR" style="width: 259px;"><img src="images/outbound/austria1.jpg" width="259" height="182"/></div>
<h2>History</h2>

<p>With an area of 83.858 sq km Austria consists of 9 independent federal states (Burgenland, Carinthia, Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Salzburg, Styria, Tyrol, Vorarlberg and Vienna) with their own provincial governments. Austria is a member of the European Union, the United Nations as well as most UN organizations.</p>
<p>Of the approximately 8 million inhabitants of Austria, 98% speak German. The six ethnic groups officially recognized in Austria (Burgenlandic Croatians, Roma, Slovaks, Slovenians, Czechs and Hungarians) are concentrated in the east and south of the country.</p>
<div class="blueLine"></div>

<h2>Climate</h2>
<p>Due to the topographical diversity and the relatively large west-east expanse, there are<br />
  three quite different climatic regions:</p>
<p><strong>East:</strong> Pannonian climate with a continental influence &#8211; low precipitation, hot summers but only moderately cold winters.</p>
<p><strong>Alpine Region:</strong> Alpine climate - high precipitation (except inner Alpine valley regions such as the<br />
  upper Inntal), short summers, long winters.</p>
<p><strong>Remainder of the country:</strong> transient climate influenced by the Atlantic (in the West) and a<br />
  continental influence in the South-east.</p>
<p><strong>Temperatures:</strong><br />
  in summer up to 95 degree Fahrenheit / average: 68 degree Fahrenheit<br />
  in winter up to - 4 degree Fahrenheit / average: 32 degree Fahrenheit</p>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<H2>Schools</h2>
<p>Pupils in Austria have to finish the four-year long elementary school, called "Volksschule". Then the class teacher decides which pupil is able to manage the higher school (Allgemeinbildende H&ouml;here Schule in German) or the compulsory school. Both school types have the same curriculum; only the learning tempo is much faster in the higher school.</p>
<p>After the four years in higher school or compulsory school, each pupil can choose between<br />
  different, specific schools which are coaching them precisely for their career. In the school<br />
  form Gymnasium they're also able to stay there and finish the schoolish matura, which is also available in career coaching schools.</p>
<p>Private schools that provide primary and secondary education and some teacher training<br />
  are run mainly, but by no means exclusively, by the Roman Catholic Church and account for<br />
  approximately 10% of the 6,800 schools and 120,000 teachers. Roman Catholic schools have a reputation for more discipline and rigor than public institutions, and some are considered elite institutions. Because there is no tradition of private university education in Austria, the state has a virtual monopoly on higher education. This has been changing slowly in recent years as private universities become more commonplace.</p>

<h1>About Belgium</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<div class="ImgR" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/outbound/belgium1.png" width="249" height="290" /></div>
<p>The name 'Belgium' is derived from Gallia Belgica, a Roman province in the northernmost part of Gaul that was inhabited by the Belgae, a mix of Celtic and Germanic peoples.  Historically, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg were known as the Low Countries, which used to cover a somewhat larger area than the current Benelux group of states. From the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century, it was a prosperous centre of commerce and culture. From the 16th century until the Belgian revolution in 1830, many battles between European powers were fought in the area of Belgium, causing it to be dubbed the battleground of Europe &#8211; a reputation strengthened by both World Wars. Upon its independence, Belgium eagerly participated in the Industrial Revolution  and, during the course of the twentieth century, possessed several colonies in Africa.  The second half of the 20th century was marked by the rise of communal conflicts between the Flemings and the Francophones fuelled by cultural differences on the one hand and an asymmetrical economic evolution of Flanders and Wallonia on the other hand. </p>

<h3>Education in Belgium</h3>
<p>The Belgian secondary education grants the pupils more choice as they enter a higher cycle. The first cycle provides a broad general basis, with only a few options to choose from (e.g. Latin, additional mathematics, technology). This should enable students to orient themselves in the most suitable way towards the many different directions available in the second and third stages. The second and third cycle are much more specific in each of the possible directions. While the youngest pupils may choose at the most two or four hours per week, the oldest pupils have the opportunity to choose between different "menus", like Math-Science, Sociology-Languages or Latin-Greek. They are then able to shape the largest part of the time they spend at school. However some core lessons are compulsory like e.g. mother-tongue course, sport, etc... This mix between compulsory and optional lessons grouped in menus make it possible to keep class structures even for the oldest students.</p>

<h3>People & Society</h3>
<ul><li>Europe's tallest man is Belgian (Alain Delaunois, 2m30)</li> 
<li>The biggest newborn baby ever recorded was Samuel Timmerman, born in the Ter Linden Hospital in Knokke, weighing 5.4 kg and 57 cm in length. (December 2006)</li>
<li>The world's richest girl lives in Brussels (Athina Onassis Roussel de Miranda, granddaughter and sole heir of Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis)</li>  
<li>Many super-rich French and Dutch people have moved to Belgium (and often taken Belgian citizenship) in order to avoid wealth taxes in their country. Wealthy French people prefer Brussels, while most Dutch millionaires have elected Antwerp as their home.</li>  
<li>In 2003, there were 884 registered Belgian comic series, up from 104 in 1985 (i.e. a 750% increase).</li>  
<li>Belgium has more comic makers per square kilometer than any other country in the world (even Japan).</li>  
<li>In 70 years of existence, 200 million books of "The Adventures of Tintin" have benn sold worldwide.</li>  
<li>Half of Belgian households have at least one pet. Domestic cats and dogs alone are over 2 million in the country, for 10 million people.</li>  
<li>97% of Belgian households receive cable TV - the highest percentage in the world.</li>  
<li>Belgian people are the most avid users of discount coupons in the world, just before the United States.</li>  
<li>Durbuy dubs itself the smallest town in the world. Although it now has less than 500 inhabitants, it was granted the rank of town in medieval times, which it hasn't lost since then.</li>  
<li>There are several famous carnivals in Wallonia, including Binche, Aalst, Fosse-la-Ville and Malmedy.</li> 
<li>There isn't only one Manneken Pis in Belgium. Apart from the world-famous statue in Brussels, Geraardsbergen has had a similar boy peeing continuously in front of its townhall since the middle of the 15th century.</li>  
<li>1.6 million people in Belgium are immigrants or children or grandchildren or immigrants, i.e 15% of the population, including 280,000 of Italian origin and 240,000 of Moroccan origin.</li>  
<li>A 2007 UNICEF report on child well-being in rich countries ranked Belgium as the best country for children's educational well-being.</li>  
<li>According to a 2007 European Commission report, Belgium has the lowest salary gap between men and women in the EU (after Malta, where proportionally fewer women work).</li></ul>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Belgium has 3 official languages. The North (Flanders) speaks Dutch, the South (Wallonia) speaks French, and a tiny part in the East speaks German (only 0.6% of the total population). People in Brussels, at the center of the country, speak mainly French, Dutch and English. Many Belgians are at least bilingual or trilingual as a consequence.</p> 
<p>French is spoken in southern Belgium because Latin was the official language of the Merovingian and Carolingian courts (respectively based in Tournai and Liege), not for ethnic reasons. Note that Wallonia was never part of France, except for the brief interlude of the French Revolution (but so was most of Europe).</p>

<h1>About Denmark</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 245px;"><img src="images/outbound/denmark1.png" width="245" height="284" /></div>
<p>It is the southernmost of the Nordic countries, southwest of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. Denmark borders both the Baltic and the North Sea. The country consists of a large peninsula, Jutland (Jylland) and many islands, most notably Zealand (Sjælland), Funen (Fyn), Vendsyssel-Thy, Lolland, Falster and Bornholm, as well as hundreds of minor islands often referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark has long controlled the approach to the Baltic Sea; before the digging of the Kiel Canal water passage to the Baltic was possible only through the three channels known as the "Danish straits".</p>
<p>Denmark is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government. Denmark has a state-level government and local governments in 98 municipalities. Denmark has been a member of the European Union since 1973, although it has not joined the Eurozone. Denmark is a founding member of NATO and the OECD. Denmark is also a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). As an OSCE participating State, Denmark's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the U.S. Helsinki Commission.</p>

<h3>Education in Denmark</h3>
<p>Education in Denmark is compulsory for children aged approximately 6-15/16. The school years up to the age of fifteen/sixteen are known as Folkeskole ("public school"). About 82% of young people take further education in addition to this. Government-funded education is usually free of charge and open to everyone. Denmark has a tradition of private schools and about 13% of all children at basic school level attend private schools.
The Education Index, published with the UN's Human Development Index in 2008, based on data from 2006, lists Denmark as 0.993, amongst the highest in the world, tied for first with Australia, Finland and New Zealand. </p>

<h3>History & Culture</h3>
<ul><li>Denmark is the homeland of the Germanic ethnicity and culture. The Franks, Burgundians, Jutes, and the Norses (Vikings) all trace their origin back to Denmark (as well as Norway and Sweden for the latter). 
<li>In the 9th and 10th centuries, Danish Vikings invaded and settled in parts of Western Europe as far as North Africa. They founded the Danelaw in Northern England, and were granted to Duchy of Normandy (named after the Norse men) by the King of France. 
<li>As a result of the "Danish exodus" in ancient and medieval times, most people in Germany, the Benelux, Northern and Eastern France, and Britain can claim Danish ancestry. 
<li>The Danish royal family is probably the oldest uninterrupted European monarchy. It traces back its roots to legendary kings in the Antiquity. Gorm the Old, the first king of the "official line", ruled from 934 C.E. 
<li>Between 1397 and 1524, the whole of Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland) as well as southern Finland was unified under Danish rule, with Copenhagen as capital. The Denmark-Norway Union (including Iceland and Greenland) lasted until 1814. 
<li>The Danish prince Hamlet, the fictional character of William Shakespeare's famous play, was inspired by an old Danish myth of the Viking Prince Amled of Jutland. 
<li>The Danish fairy tales writer Hans Christian Andersen, is well known around the Western world, notably for such tales as "The Emperor's New Clothes", "The Little Mermaid" (adapted by Disney), and "The Ugly Duckling". 
<li>The architect of the iconic Sydney Opera House was the Dane Jørn Utzon (1918-2008). In 2007, he became only the second person to have his work recognised as a World Heritage Site while he was still alive.</li></ul><br>

<h1>About Ecuador</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 256px;"><img src="images/outbound/equador1.png" width="256" height="297" /></div>
<p>Ecuador straddles the equator, from which it takes its name, and has an area of 256,370 square kilometers (98,990 sq mi). Its capital city is Quito, which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in the 1970s for having the best preserved and least altered historic center in Latin America.  The country's largest city is Guayaquil. The historic center of Cuenca, the third largest city in the country, was also declared a World Heritage Site in 1999, for being an outstanding example of a planned inland Spanish style colonial city in the Americas . Ecuador is also home&#8211;despite its size&#8211;to a great variety of species, many of them endemic, like those of the Galápagos islands. This species diversity makes Ecuador one of the seventeen megadiverse countries in the world.  The new constitution of 2008 is the first in the world to recognize legally enforceable Rights of Nature, or ecosystem rights</p>

<h3>Education in Ecuador</h3>
<p>The educational systems in Ecuador are very strong. Students who fall under the group of five to fourteen, are supposed to attend the school everyday at any cost. To some extent the public education in Ecuador is free. However, according to the ministry of Education in Ecuador, only 10% of the rural population attends the school level education. On the other hand, about 76% of the total number of children in Ecuador completes their study till the class six.<br /> <br />
There are total 61 universities in the country of Ecuador. Most of these universities provide the degrees of graduation. The post graduation degrees are also provided by some of the universities. The universities and other educational institutions also provide various types of post-secondary vocational trainings and other types of technical trainings. <br /><br />
In Ecuador education is also available to the lower and disadvantaged classes too. There is no discrimination ion the ground of age, sex and cast in the field education in Ecuador.</p>

<h3>Ecology & Environment</h3>
<p> Overview: In the Ecuadorian Amazon, which represents just two percent of the whole basin, live one-third of all the bird species in the entire Amazon region, and 10 percent of all the tree species on earth. Over 24 tropical life zones are found in Ecuador (according to the Holdridge Life Zone system) including: mangrove swamp, dry tropical forest, tropical cloud forest, paramo, and tropical lowland rainforest. Due to its great variety of life zones, Ecuador boasts one the highest levels of bio-diversity in the world. For example one hectare of lowland rainforest can contain as many frog species as in all of North America; one tree can contain more ant species than in all of the British Isles combined; and of the world's known bird species (about 9,000), pint-sized Ecuador is home to over 1,500. Ecuador also has one of the greatest levels of endemism anywhere in the world.</p> 
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>Spanish is the official language of the Republic of Ecuador. Even though other languages and dialects are spoken by the different ethnic groups in Ecuador. Among these languages, quechua is the most spoken, it is spoken in the towns of the rocky mountain range and jungle where there is two dialects, quechua of napo and the pastaza quechua. Several small lowland groups speak their own languages. English is understood in the best hotels and in airline offices and travel agencies, but it's of little use elsewhere.</p>

<h1>About England</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 230px;"><img src="images/outbound/england1.png" width="230" height="268" /></div>
<p>The Kingdom of England&#8211;which after 1284 included Wales&#8211;was a sovereign state until 1 May 1707, when the Acts of Union put into effect the terms agreed in the Treaty of Union the previous year, resulting in a political union with the Kingdom of Scotland to create the new Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1800, Great Britain was united with Ireland through another Act of Union to become the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1922, the Irish Free State was established as a separate dominion, but the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act in 1927 reincorporated into the kingdom six Irish counties to officially create the current United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>England's terrain mostly comprises low hills and plains, especially in central and southern England. However, there are uplands in the north (for example, the mountainous Lake District, Pennines, and Yorkshire Dales) and in the south west (for example, Dartmoor and the Cotswolds). London, England's capital, is the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom and the largest urban zone in the European Union by most measures. England's population is about 51 million, around 84% of the population of the United Kingdom, and is largely concentrated in London, the South East and conurbations in the Midlands, the North West, the North East and Yorkshire, which developed as major industrial regions during the 19th century. Meadowlands and pastures are found beyond the major cities.</p>
<h3>Education in England</h3>
<p>Education in England is overseen by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. At a local level the local authorities take responsibility for implementing policy for public education and state schools.</p>
<p>English secondary schools are mostly comprehensive, except in a few areas that retain a form of the previous selective system (the Tripartite System), with students selected for grammar school by the eleven plus exam. There are also a number of isolated fully selective grammar schools, and a few dozen partially selective schools. Specialist schools may also select up to 10% of their intake for aptitude in the specialism, though relatively few of them have taken up this option. Also, intakes of comprehensive schools can vary widely, especially in urban areas with several schools.</p>

 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 250px;"><img src="images/outbound/france1.png" width="247" height="288" /></div>
<p>France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its main ideals expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. France is one of the most developed countries  and possesses the fifth largest economy by nominal GDP  and seventh largest economy by purchasing power parity. France enjoys a high standard of living as well as a high public education level, it's one of the most globalised nations, has 2009's second best international reputation and has also one of the world's highest life expectancies, with its healthcare system rated as the best in the world. It is the most visited country in the world, receiving 82 million foreign tourists annually.  France is one of the founding members of the European Union. It is also a founding member of the United Nations, and a member of the Francophonie, the G8, G20, NATO, OECD, WTO, and the Latin Union. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, possesses the third largest number of nuclear weapons in the world and the largest number of nuclear power plants in the European Union.</p>

<h3>Education in France</h3>
<h4>French secondary education is divided into two schools:</h4>
<ul><li>The coll&#232;ge for the first four years directly following primary school;</li>
<li>The lyc&#232;e for the next three years.</li></ul>
<p>The completion of secondary studies leads to the baccalaur&egrave;at.
The school year starts in early September and ends in early-July. French school holidays are scheduled by the Ministry of Education, by dividing the country into three zones (A, B, and C) to prevent the overcrowding by family holidaymakers of tourist destinations such as the Mediterranean coast and the ski resorts. Lyon, for example, is in zone A, while Marseille is in zone B, and Paris and Bordeaux are in zone C.
In contrast to the practice in most other education systems, the various school years in France are numbered on a decreasing scale. Thus, pupils begin their secondary education in the sixi&egrave;me (6th class), and transfer to a lyc&egrave;e in the seconde (2nd class), while the final year is the terminale.
In French, the word for student (&egrave;tudiant) is usually reserved for university-level students, while coll&egrave;ge and lyc&egrave;e students are referred to as &egrave;l&egrave;ves (pupils or students in English).
The curriculum (le programme officiel) is standardized for all French public institutions. Changes to the programme are made every year by the French Ministry of Education and are published in the Ministry's Bulletin Officiel de l'&egrave;ducation Nationale (BO), the official reference bulletin for educators.</p>

<H2>Did You Know About France?</h2>
<h3>History</h3>
<ul><li>The name "France" comes from "Frank", a Germanic tribe that invaded the Western Roman Empire in the 6th century and founded the first independent kingdom covering most of today's France.</li> 
<li>The French state is one of the oldest in Europe; it was founded in 843, splitting from the Carolingian Empire based in Aachen (Belgo-German border).</li>  
<li>The region of Paris was settled since around 4200 BCE. The city itself was founded by the Parisii, a Celtic tribe, around 250 BCE. The Roman renamed it Luteca from 52 BCE, and it only became known as "Paris" after the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century.</li>  
<li>Foie gras may be part and parcel of French cuisine, but its origins go back to 4,500 years ago in Ancient Egypt, from where it spread to Greece (500 B.C.E.), then to the Romans, ancestors of the modern French.</li>  
<li>Gothic art has its origins in the middle of the 12th century in the North of France. The world's first Gothic building is said to be the Abbey of St. Denis, just north of Paris, which is the burial place of many Frankish kings since Clovis, as well as most Kings of France. Gothic architecture then spread to Picardy, notably with the cathedrals of Noyon, Laon and Senlis, followed by the &Icirc;le-de-France. The term "Gothic" was only used from the 16th century Renaissance as a pejorative term to describe complicated and "barbaric" art, as opposed to the simplicity of the Greco-Roman revival. Nowadays more people may value more highly Gothic than Renaissance architecture.</li>  
<li>Nicotine was named after Jean Nicot (1530-1600), a French diplomat and scholar who introduced the tobacco plant to France in 1559 (from Portugal).</li>  
<li>"La Marseillaise", France's national anthem, was composed in Strasbourg in 1792, not in Marseilles as its name might induce to think.</li>  
<li>The world's first international scientific conference was held in Paris on 2 February 1799.</li>  
<li>The first modern fire-resistant safe deposit box was invented by Alexandre Fichet (1799-1862) around 1840.</li>  
<li>The world's first true department store was Le Bon March&eacute; in Paris, founded by Aristide Boucicaut in 1838.</li>  
<li>The tradition of decorating Chritmas trees started in Eastern France in the 16th century (then part of Germany). Trees were then ornated with flowers and fruits (notably apples). A drought in 1858 destroyed the apple harvest, prompting a glass blower from Goetzenbruck, a Lorraine village on the Moselle, to create apple-shaped glass baubles. The practice spread quickly around Europe, and by the late 1800's the local glass factory at Goetzenbruck was manufacturing tens of thousands of baubles.</li>  
<li>At its peak, between 1919 and 1939, the second French colonial empire extended over 12,347,000 km&sup2; (4,767,000 sq. miles) of land, or 8.6% of the world's land area. This is over 22 times the size of modern Metropolitan France. </li> 
<li>France has hosted five times the Summer Olympic Games (2nd most after the USA), three times the Winter Olympic Games (2nd most after the USA), and twice the FIFA World Cup (most with Italy and Germany).</li>  
<li>France has won the 4th most Summer Olympic medals (including gold) in history after the USA, USSR and UK.</li>  
<li>France has won the most Nobel Prizes for Literature of any country (13 so far) and the second highest number of Field Medals (mathematics) after the USA.</li>  
<li>The capital of Malta, Valletta, was built by and named after the French nobleman Jean Parisot de la Valette (1494-1568), Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller and ruler of the island.</li>  
<li>On 10 June 2007, a sabre having belonged to Napoleon I was sold at an auction for &pound;4.8 million - the most expensive weapon ever sold.</li></ul>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<h2>Culture & Sciences</h2>
<ul><li>There are some 40,000 ch&acirc;teaux (castles, manors, palaces...) in France. 
<li>Famous French inventions include the adding machine, the hot air balloon, the airship, the parachute, the submarine, the ambulance service, photography, animation and cinema. 
<li>France is the country that has won the most Nobel prizes for literature (13 as of 2005, with the last prize going back to 1985). 
<li>French people are the second biggest consumers of alcohol per capita in the Western world - after Luxembourg... 
<li>A 2007 study revealed that the French were the biggest consumers of medicines in Europe, both in quantity and total money spent per person. 
<li>There are over 300 kinds of cheese made in France. 
<li>There are 28 categories of sites in France listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, including 3 Roman sites (Arles, Orange and Le Gard), 4 cathedrals (Amiens, Bourges, Chartres, Reims), 4 abbeys (Fontenay, Reims, Saint-Savin sur Gartempe and Vezelay), 8 historic city/town centres (Paris, Strasbourg, Lyon, Avignon, Le Havre, Mont-Saint-Michel, Provins and Carcassone) as well as numerous belfries, castles and palaces. 
<li>More tourists visit France each year than any other country in the world, with 67 million annual tourist arrivals (more than the country's population). 
<li>The spectacle "Ionesco" has been playing at the Th&egrave;&acirc;tre de La Huchette since 1957, with over 15,000 performances - a world record. 
<li>There are about 2 new cooking books published every day in France. 
<li>Pop singer Claude Fran&ccedil;ois (1939-1978) is still as popular as ever in France 30 years after his accidental death. Two of his songs have remained constantly in the top 10 of music played in night club for the last 20 years. A real cult has developed around him. In many ways, Claude François can be regarded as the French equivalent of Elvis Presley. 
<li>About one fourth of French people nowadays choose to be cremated when they die, instead of the traditional Catholic burial. 
<li>"Remember, if there are any complaints, in France, the customer is always wrong." (from the film A Good Year)</li></ul>

 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 247px;"><img src="images/outbound/Germany1.png" width="247" height="288" /></div>
 <p>Germany is a federal parliamentary republic of sixteen states (L&#228;nder). The capital and largest city is Berlin. Germany is a member of the United Nations, NATO, G8, G20, OECD, and the WTO. It is a major power with the world's fourth largest economy by nominal GDP and the fifth largest in purchasing power parity. It is the second largest exporter and third largest importer of goods. In absolute terms, Germany allocates the second biggest annual budget of development aid in the world,  while its military expenditure ranked sixth. The country has developed a high standard of living and established a comprehensive system of social security. It holds a key position in European affairs and maintains a multitude of close partnerships on a global level.  Germany is recognized as a scientific and technological leader in several fields.</p>

<h3>Education in Germany</strong></h3>

<p>Secondary education includes four types of schools: the Gymnasium is designed to prepare pupils for university education and finishes with the final examination, Abitur, after grade 12 or 13. The Realschule has a broader range of emphasis for intermediate pupils and finishes with the final examination, Mittlere Reife, after grade 10; the Hauptschule prepares pupils for vocational education and finishes with the final examination, Hauptschulabschluss, after grade 9 or 10 and the Realschulabschluss after grade 10. There are two types of grade 10: one is the higher level called type 10b and the lower level is called type 10a; only the higher level type 10b can lead to the Realschule and this finishes with the final examination Mittlere Reife after grade 10b. This new path of achieving the Realschulabschluss at a vocationally-oriented secondary school was changed by the statutory school regulations in 1981 - with a one-year qualifying period. During the one-year qualifying period of the change to the new regulations, pupils could continue with class 10 to fulfil the statutory period of education. After 1982, the new path was compulsory, as explained above. Other than this, there is the Gesamtschule, which combines the three approaches. There are also F&#246;rderschulen/Sonderschulen. One in 21 pupils attends a F&#246;rderschule.</p>

<li>The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was founded by Charlemagne in Aachen in 800 C.E. It lasted over a thousand years, until 1806, when Napoleon dissolved it (mostly because he saw himself as the heir of Charlemagne, the new Emperor of the Occident).</li>  
<li>The Weihenstephaner Brewery in Freising, Bavaria, has been operating since its foundation in 1040, which makes it the world's oldest brewery.</li>  
<li>Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) is the first composer whose biography is known. Her works are considered the foundation to what later became known as opera (over 400 years later).</li>  
<li>Germany played a central role in the Reformation of Christianity. Johannes Gutenberg (1400-1468) printed the world's very first Bible in Mainz in 1456. The development the printing press allowed ordinary people to possess a copy of the holy book, previously reserved to the clergy and nobility. It didn't take long before another German, Martin Luther (1483-1546), compared the actual content of the Bible to the teachings and practices of the Catholic Church, and found major discrepancies. In 1517, Luther famously posted his 95 Thesis on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg (Saxony-Anhalt), in which he emphasized the Bible as the sole source of religious authority and the church as a priesthood of all believers. The Protestant Reformation would cause the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) throughout the Holy Roman Empire, and resulted among others in the independence of Switzerland and of the United Provinces of the Netherlands. </li> 
<li>The University of Marburg (Philipps-Universit&auml;t Marburg), in Hesse, was founded in 1527 as the world's first Protestant university.</li>  
<li>The world's oldest savings bank was established in Oldenburg (Lower Saxony) in 1786. </li> 
<li>Germany has had quite a few capitals in its turbulent history, notably (in chronological order) : Aachen (from 794), Regensburg (seat of the Reichstag from 1663 to 1806), Frankfurt-am-Main (site of the election and coronation of German emperors between 1152 and 1792, seat of the Bundestag of the German Confederation from 1815 to 1871), Berlin (from 1871 to 1949, and 1990 to present), and Bonn (from 1949 to 1990 - West Germany only).</li></ul>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<h2>Land & People</h2>
<ul><li>Germany is the most populous European country (apart from Russia), with a population of 81 million. </li> 
<li>Germany's land area was over 50% larger during the Second Reich (1871-1918) and included most of present-day Poland and parts of Lithuania.</li>  
<li>German people are the second biggest consumers of beer in the world (after the Irish), with an average of 119 litres per person per year (or 0.32 l per day).</li>  
<li>The German language was once the lingua franca of central, eastern and northern Europe, and remains the language with the most native speakers in Europe.</li>  
<li>15 million people in Germany are of non-German descent (first and second generation), i.e. 18.5% of the population. About half of them are foreign residents, not German citizens.</li>  
<li>About a quarter of all American citizens claim at least partial German ancestry.</li>  
<li>Germany has nearly 700 zoological gardens, wildlife parks, aquariums, bird parks, animal reserves, or safari parks, including 414 registered zoos (more than the USA) ! Berlin's Zoologischer Garten is the largest zoo in the world, both in terms of number of species (1,500) and animal population (14,000). </li> 
<li>The world's youngest billionnaire is the German Prince Albert II von Thurn und Taxis, with net worth is estimated at around $1.9 billion (USD) as of 2006.</li>  
<li>German athletes have won a total of 1548 Olympic medals (summer and winter combined), i.e. more than any other country in the world except the USA.</li>

<h1>About Ireland</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<div class="ImgR" style="width: 286px;"><img src="images/outbound/irelandII.png" width="286" height="186" /></div>
<p>Ireland is the third-largest island in Europe and the twentieth-largest island in the world. It lies to the northwest of continental Europe and is surrounded by hundreds of islands and islets. To the east of Ireland is Great Britain, separated from it by the Irish Sea. The island is divided between the Republic of Ireland, which covers just under five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom, which covers the remainder and is located in the northeast of the island. The population of Ireland is approximately 6.2 million people. About 4.5 million live in the Republic of Ireland and just under 1.8 million live in Northern Ireland.  
</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>There are three distinct levels of education in Ireland: primary, secondary and higher (often known as "third-level") education. In recent years further education has grown immensely. Growth in the economy since the 1960s has driven much of the change in the education system. Education in Ireland is free at all levels, including college (university), but only for students applying from the EU. There are Student Services Fees which students are required to pay on registration, to cover examinations, insurance and registration costs.</p>
<p>Secondary education: Most students attend and complete secondary education, with approximately ninety percent of school-leavers taking the terminal examination, the Leaving Certificate, at age 16 -19. (That is; at the 6th year at secondary school.) Secondary education is generally completed at one of three types of school.</p>
<ul><li>Voluntary secondary schools, or just "secondary schools", are owned and managed by religious communities or private organizations. The state funds 90% of teachers' salaries and 95% of other costs. Such schools cater for 57% of secondary pupils.</li>
<li>Vocational schools are owned and managed by Vocational Education Committees, with 93% of their costs met by the state. These schools educate 28% of secondary pupils.</li>
<li>Comprehensive schools or community schools were established in the 1960s, often by amalgamating voluntary secondary and vocational schools. They are fully funded by the state, and run by local boards of management. Nearly 15% of secondary pupils attend such schools.</li></ul>
<p>In urban areas, there is considerable freedom in choosing the type of school the child will attend. The emphasis of the education system at second level is as much on breadth as on depth; the system attempts to prepare the individual for society and further education or work. This is similar to the education system in Scotland.

<h1>About Italy</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
<div class="ImgR" style="width: 246px;"><img src="images/outbound/italy1.png" width="246" height="287" /></div>
<p>Italy plays a prominent role in European and global military, cultural and diplomatic affairs, and it is affiliated with worldwide organizations such as the Food and Agriculture Organization, World Food Programme, International Fund for Agricultural Development, Glocal Forum, and the NATO Defence College, which are headquartered in Rome. The country's European political, social and economic influence make it a major regional power, alongside the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Russia, and Italy has been classified in a study, measuring hard power, as being the eleventh greatest worldwide national power.  The country has a high public education level, high labour force, is a globalised nation, and also has 2009's sixth best international reputation.  Italy also has the world's nineteenth highest life expectancy, and in 2000 its healthcare system was ranked the second best in the world by the World Health Organization Report. In 2007 it was the world's fifth most visited country, with over 43.7 million international arrivals, and boasts a long tradition in the arts, science and technology, including the world's highest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites to date.</p>

<h3>Education in Italy</h3>
<p>Secondary education (Scuole medie) is further divided in two stages: "Medie Inferiori", which correspond to the Middle School grades, and "Medie Superiori", which correspond to the High School level.<br />
The lower tier of "Scuole Media" corresponds to Middle School, lasts three years, and involves an exam at the end of the third year; "Scuole Superiori" usually last five years (even though istituti professionali might offer a diploma after only three years). Every tier involves an exam at the end of the final year, required to access the following tier.<br />
The secondary school situation varies, since there are several types of schools differentiated by subjects and activities. The main division is between the "Liceo", the "Istituto Tecnico" and the "Istituto Professionale". Any kind of secondary school that lasts 5 years grants access to the final exam, called Esame di Stato conclusivo del corso di studio di Istruzione Secondaria Superiore or Esame di Maturit&agrave;. This exam takes place every year in June and July and grants access to any faculty at any University.</p>

<h1>About Norway</h1>
<div class="blueLine"></div>
 <div class="ImgR" style="width: 240px;"><img src="images/outbound/norway2.jpg" width="240" height="280" /></div>
<p>Many tourists claim that a visit to Norway is like being in a fairytale. Norway's magnificent scenery and untamed nature have long captivated visitors. Spectacular fjords indent the rugged coastline, stunning waterfalls and enourmous glaciers, mountains rise above tranquil valleys. Norway is the land of the midlight sun and shimmering Northern Lights.</p>
<p>This is a country where music, art and literature are part of its soul, where sports such as skiing and football are actively pursued, and current affairs are hotly debated. It is also the home of Nobel Peace Prize. The capital, Oslo is a vibrant city centered round a harbor and guarded by a castle. Norwegians are lucky to have four seasons and they all have their charm! Norwegians enjoy being one of the world's top skiing nations and the winter sports centers have something to offer everyone, both beginners and experienced skiers.</p>
<p>The arrival of spring brings long light-filled days. Norway celebrates National Day on 17th of May with children's parades and festivities. In summer Norwegians head for the islands and skerries. There are boat festivals, fairs and games all the way along the coast. Autumn is the season for theatre-going, concerts, opera (in our new stunning opera house!), dance, film premieres and art exhibitions. In essence, Norway has you everything you need!</p>

<p>Norwegians are hospitable and friendly people who will welcome you to their home with great pleasure. They enjoy travelling and getting to know new people as well as sharing their own culture. The Norwegians are proud of their country and this can be seen on the National day (17th of May), when they dress up in folk costumes also known as &quot;bunad&quot;. Yet this nationalistic outlook does not prevent them from welcoming foreigners to into their culture. It will not take long before you feel a part of the Norwegian culture!</p>

<h2>Education in Spain</h2>

<h3> Below Higher Education the system can be seen as consisting of four levels:</strong></h3>
 <ul> <li>Pre-school (<em>Educaci&#243;n Infantil</em>, segundo ciclo) - 3 to 6 years of age</li>
  <li>Primary School (<em>Educaci&#243;n Primaria</em>) six years of schooling - 6 to 12 years of age</li>
  <li>Compulsory Secondary Education (<em>Educaci&#243;n Secundaria Obligatoria</em>) four years of schooling - 12 to 16 years of age</li>
  <li>Post-Compulsory Schooling (<em>Bachillerato</em>) two years of schooling - 16 to 18 years of age</li></ul>

<p>Children 3 to 6 years old in have the option of attending the stage (<em>infantil</em> or popularly known as <em>preescolar</em>), which is non-compulsory and free for all students. It is regarded as an integral part of the education system with infants' classes at almost every primary school. There are some separate nursery schools (<em>Colegios Infantiles</em>). Children (whose parents chose that they should) enter pre-school (<em>Educaci&#243;n Infantil</em>) in the autumn of the calendar year in which they turn three years old. Following this pattern, the ages given here as corresponding to the different phases are the ages turned by children in the calendar year in which the academic year begins. Age ranges are inclusive: 3 to 5 years of age is 3 academic years.</p>


<p>Spanish students aged 6 to 16 undergo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school" title="Primary school"> </a>(<em>colegio</em>) and (<em>instituto</em>) education, which are compulsory and (like the preceding preschool from age 3) free of charge. Successful students are awarded a Secondary Education Certificate, which is necessary to enter the post-compulsory stage of Schooling (principally the <em>Bachillerato</em>) for their University or Vocational (<em>Formaci&#243;n Profesional</em>) Studies. Once students have finished their <em>Bachillerato</em>, they can take their University Entrance Exam (<em>Pruebas de Acceso a la Universidad</em>, popularly called <em>Selectividad</em>) which differs greatly from region to region. The compulsory stage of secondary education is normally referred to by its initials: ESO (<em>Educaci&#243;n Secundaria Obligatoria</em>).</p><br />

<p>Sweden has a lot more than meatballs and IKEA to offer. Sweden's exceptional natural scenery and enormous tracts of untouched wilderness are a major attraction as well as cities such as Stockholm
with natural beauty, cultural heritage and modern international
urban culture. We are a long country with big differences in
landscape between north and south. In the north we have the
mountains, the Nordic light, the bigger national parks and major
areas with forest. In the south we have more water (closer to both
the ocean and lakes), more farmland and closer between different
cities and towns. Art, music and nature are important to Swedes
not only today but also from an historical point of view. Swedes
are friendly people who enjoy travelling and experiencing new
cultures (as well as sharing their own!)</p>
<p>Even if we are proud of our
country many Swedes have visit different parts of the world and
are interested in learning more about other countries.
As an exchange student, you stay in one of
our selected host families and attend a local
school Monday to Friday. You can choose to
stay for five or ten months starting in January
or August. A typical Swedish school year
begins in mid August and ends in early June
with a ten weeks summer holiday. To become
an exchange student with us, you must be 15-18
years old upon arrival.
During your stay you will meet a lot of new friends and we encourage you to take part in the activities of the local community! Maybe you will try skiing, ice skating or mushroom picking?</p>

<p>Swedes are often having local clubs for different interests. This is a great way to meet new friends and learn more about Sweden. You will also be able to celebrate some of our typical traditions as for Easter (March/April), Midsummer (June), Crayfish party (August) and Lucia (December).</p>
<p>You will meet regularly with your local coordinator as well as learn more about Sweden and take part in activities together with us. Your local coordinator is there to support you and answer questions.</p>
<p>You can contact him or her at anytime. During your stay you will also be an ambassador for home culture, so be prepared for all types of questions about your country. You might wake up an interest from Swedes to go see your country on a future holiday.</p>
