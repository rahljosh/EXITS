  ISE host families are volunteers who are usually found through presentations to local church and civic groups. Prior host families also refer new families to us.</span></div></td>

  There are many reasons. Some families want to give their children a chance to meet other young people from different countries. For some families, it is the opportunity to share the American culture while learning about a foreign culture. For others, it is a way of promoting world peace and understanding. Whatever the reason, all ISE host families will tell you that hosting is fun and educational for everyone. </span></div></td>

  We do not encourage this. If a family wishes to come, we recommend coming at the end of the program. It is neither wise nor polite to assume that the host family will be able to accommodate extra guests. The natural family should plan on staying at a local hotel. </span></div></td>

  No. While on the ISE program, a student may only travel with the host family, the ISE Area Representative or on a school or church sanctioned trip. Students may not leave their host community area to visit friends or relatives in other cities. From time to time, ISE approves trips provided by a certain tour operator who is experienced in dealing with foreign students. Information about these trips will be provided to students during their stay in the US. The Area Representative can provide complete and specific details about the ISE policy for approved travel. </span></div></td>

  Although ISE carefully screens students for their ability to be successful in our program, from time to time a student experiences difficulty with English. ISE may require that a student secure a tutor at the student's expense should a lack of English language skills prevent a student from succeeding in the program.</span></div></td>
