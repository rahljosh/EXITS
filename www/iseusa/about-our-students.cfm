    <p class="p1"><strong>International Student Exchange (ISE)</strong> is dedicated to the promotion of world peace and understanding by bringing together foreign teens with volunteer American host families. Our programs allow students from more than 55 countries to become familiar with the American way of life by experiencing its schools, homes and communities. A sincere desire to embrace the "one world" philosophy, inquisitiveness about other cultures, and the ability to provide a loving home as well as room and board are the prerequisites to being a host family.</p>
<p class="p1">
ISE offers semester programs as well as school year programs. ISE can now also offer students the opportunity to study at some of America's finest Private High Schools. ISE works with a network of independent international educational partners who provide information, screening and orientations for prospective applicants. ISE is designated by the Department of State as a sponsor of an exchange visitor program. The Council on Standards for International Educational Travel (CSIET) has accepted ISE for listing in the 2009-10 Advisory List. Students between 15 and 18.5 years upon arrival may apply to our program for a semester of study or for the full school year.</p>
