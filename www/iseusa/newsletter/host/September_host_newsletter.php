<h1>High-Five</h1>

<h3>Giving a High-Five to the Dixon Family!  They are located out of Hartford, MI and have been a host family for 8 years.</h3>
<p><strong>Q1: <em>What made you want to be a Host Family? &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>We became a host family by accident. Our son became friends with a Brasilian student, Roberto, in 2007. He encountered a difficult situation, the boys put their heads together to find a way for him to live with us and our journey began. 13 students later here we are.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q2: <em>What&rsquo;s the best part about being a Host Family?</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>The best part of hosting would be all of the exposure that our children get to other cultures. Our oldest daughter is Brasil obsessed. We have discovered that it is very much a learning experience for the student and the host family.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q3:&nbsp;<em>What do you usually do with your student(s) for fun?</em> </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> We are in a small town so everyday fun can range from a movie or a crazy dinner table conversation. Shopping is 35 minutes away so we don't do that too often. Our students leave knowing what life in small town America with a working class family is like.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q4: <em>Any great stories you want to share?</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>Oh my goodness, there are so many.  Things like explaining what gravy is.  We had one student in our family, Danilo, that his parents sent us all matching Brasil sweats and jackets.  That is our unofficial family Christmas picture.</em></p>

<p class="grey"><em>We had a boy from South Korea, Jae, and we told him he had a good singing voice and from that time on he sang constantly!  Driving his roommate another boy from Brasil, Bernardo, absolutely insane. We are also foster parents so our students have seen how that system works. Our daughter Delaney and Nadja, from Germany walked about a mile to McDonalds in a blizzard.</em></p>  

<p class="grey"><em>Our girls, Nadja and Barbara, were amazing when we were new to fostering. So many stories it truly is hard to pick one. We love all of our foreign family so very much.  Each one has a special place in our hearts!</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q5: <em>Any Advice for other host families?</em></strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> Treat them as if you would your own children.  The exchangers are special but they are also a part of your family's day to day life. Make sure your house rules are clear, they are teenagers and they try to push boundaries. Most of all enjoy the semester or academic year. The students program goes by so quickly. Tell them to take lots of pictures, journal or whatever they can to take special memories home and share with their natural parents parts of our culture. Enjoy and encourage them to try a little bit of everything their schools have to offer!</em></p>

<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>

<p>The Facilitator Team thanks you for opening your home to a foreign exchange student.  We hope you've found your host family packet and manual helpful and encourage you to review this information in detail.   In addition to the family packet, we'll be presenting timely topics throughout the year via this newsletter and hope this additional information will help you assist your exchange student in their adjustment to life in the US.</p>
<h3>Topics</h3>
  <p><strong>Establish House Rules:</strong> Establish rules and expectations with your exchange student early on (fill out form together and put up on your fridge) and review ISE program rules and program policies in the ISE handbook. Be sure to fill out the Computer Usage Expectations Worksheet as well.  We would also recommend against including exchange students on your cell phone plans as this has resulted in unexpected bills for families in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Adjustment</strong>: Many students go through feelings of homesickness when they arrive and experience highs and lows in their first few weeks or months. Your family will also notice adjustment issues as you take on a new family member. </p>
<p><strong>Insurance Info:</strong> Students on the ISE high school program are covered under an insurance plan issued by Global Secutive and claims are managed by United Healthcare. Please take a moment to visit the Global Secutive website (<a href="http://www.esecutive.com/index.php">http://www.esecutive.com/index.php</a>) and review options for doctors in your area.  Please also identify a local urgent care clinic. While all communities do not have urgent care clinics, it is usually a more preferable option than an emergency room as the service usually happens faster and students aren't subject to special emergency room visit charges. Urgent care clinics can usually treat sprains, broken bones, minor cuts and burns and other non-life threatening situations and emergency rooms are better suited for significant injury, breathing difficulties and other significant emergency health concerns. Please contact the ISE office if you have any insurance questions at <a href="tel:800.766.4656" target="_blank">800.766.4656</a>. Please have your student make a copy of their insurance card and keep the copy in a safe place and make sure the student keeps the card with them at all times.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> We encourage you to contact your area rep, no matter how big or small the issue. The earlier ISE is made aware of any situation, the more quickly we can address an remedy it.</p>
<p>Your local area representative is your most important contact for ISE. However, our facilitator team, based in ISE's home office, is also there to assists area representatives, students and host families with any questions or challenges that arise during the program. The facilitator may contact your exchange student or you directly if we feel this will be helpful. We recommend that your family address any issues to your local area representative, but when needed, you can contact our home office at 800-766-4656.</p>
