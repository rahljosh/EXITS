<h1>High-Five</h1>

<h3>Giving a High-Five to the Howey Family!  They are located out of Baxter Springs, Kansas and are hosting for the first time.</h3>
<p><strong>Q1: What made you want to be a Host Family?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>We hosted an exchange student back in 1996, but just for two weeks.  We also have hosted many players on ball teams from other states, when they were here for tournaments. So we were used to having people in our home at times.</em></p>

<p class="grey"><em>It is kind of a long story, but we felt like we could do missions work in our home through the students, and we felt like God had a part in how we came to host the students through our representative.  We also enjoy people from everywhere, so we thought it would be very interesting to host.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q2: What’s the best part about being a Host Family?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I think sharing each other’s everyday living, cultures, customs, and foods.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q3: What do you usually do with your student(s) for fun?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong><em> We have gone places in our surrounding area, took them to some of our highlights around us.  We have been to Branson, Mo. We go bowling, movies, and just family fun. We stay involved in whatever they are involved in their school.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q4: Any great stories you want to share?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>We had so many good times with them, to many to share really, it's been an overall great experience.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q5: Any Advice for other host families?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong> We have two exchange students, and it is very important to make sure you include both of your students in on your conversation, even when only one of them is asking advice or questions, so the other can learn or comment, and be in on the conversation, so they are both having the best experience they can have. Very important to do a lot of listening, and learn about them, their families and most of all about their heart, they are no different than what our children were, they want your love and attention.  It's not about us hosting the students, it's about opening our home for they have a real American Experience.  Loving it very much!</em></p>

<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>
<p><strong>January 2014</strong></p>
<p>Dear ISE Host Families:</p>
<p>We hope you are all enjoying the winter months and staying warm in this year or exceptionally cold weather.  For many exchange students, this might be the first time they&rsquo;ve experienced snow and cold.  While it is certainly exciting for them, please be aware that student from the warm-weather countries might not be familiar with the issues related to cold.  I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve already been instructing your exchange student to do things like dress in layers and wear a hat and gloves.  I also may help to provide them with more information on issues like hypothermia and frostbite and the Centers for Disease Control offers an <a href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/staysafe/index.asp">online guide</a> to cold-related issues.</p>
<h2>Topics</h2>
<p><strong>Tax Break for hosting</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that you can claim a tax deduction for your exchange student?  For each month that you host an exchange student, you may claim a $50 tax deduction.  So if you host a student from August until June, you could claim a $250 deduction in 2013 and another $300 deduction in 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Traveling with your Student</strong></p>
<p>With the Spring Break coming up soon for most schools, families will often want to travel with their exchange student.  This is greatly encouraged and allows the student to experience more of the US.  Please notify your ISE Area Representative of your travel plans at least two-weeks prior to any domestic trip and one month prior to any cruise or international trip, including Canada and Mexico.  <br />
  If you are taking a cruise or traveling out of the country students must have a signed travel authorization from ISE.  Each year we get panicked calls from families that are not able to board a cruise or are having trouble returning to the US because the student didn&rsquo;t have an approved travel authorization.<br />
  It&rsquo;s up to the individual family, but it is OK for a host family to expect the exchange student to cover significant costs associated with a trip including airfare and their own hotel room and meals. </p>
<p><strong>Visits from Natural Family</strong></p>
<p>At this time of year, natural family members will be missing their sons and daughters and want to visit them in the US.  Natural family visits <strong><u>are not allowed during</u></strong> ISE exchange program as we feel that it disrupts the student&rsquo;s cultural acclimation and has the potential to cause problems.  Natural parents have all been notified in advance that these kinds of visits are not allowed if you are asked by your student or their parents about a visit, please notify your ISE Area Representative and we&rsquo;ll follow-up with the parent.  </p>
<p>Natural parent visits are <strong><u>allowed at the end of the program</u></strong>, but it is up to each host family to determine whether this is acceptable and what the arrangements might be.  So for example, maybe you are OK with the natural family visiting, don&rsquo;t feel there is room in your home for two or more extra guests so you can suggest a nearby hotels or B&amp;B where the natural parents can stay.</p>
