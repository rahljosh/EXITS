<h2><strong>The Holiday Season is Here</strong>!</h2>

<p>There are many things to do over the holidays.  It&rsquo;s time to plan what your schedule is going to be like.  Sometimes the most common holiday US traditions might be very new for your exchange student.  So take them out and make some memories</p>

<div class="hrLine"></div>

<h2>Project HELP</h2>

<p>The holidays are the perfect time to help out.  Your student can get involved and fulfill their Project HELP requirement.  Help out at your local food bank, clothing drive or sign up with one of our national partners.  </p>

<h1>High-Five</h1>

<h3>Giving a High-Five to the Carraway Family!  They are located out of Wesson, MS and have been a host family for 5 years.</h3>
<p><strong>Q1: <em>What made you want to be a Host Family? &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>Hosting exchange students is volunteerism at its best.  We love sharing our wonderful American lifestyle that we are blessed to have with students from around the world.  Every student that we have hosted are amazed at the hospitality of our community.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q2: <em>What&rsquo;s the best part about being a Host Family?</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>My family loves to learn about different cultures from around the world.  Since we will probably never have the opportunity to travel, we bring the world to us.  I do have big plans to visit all my international babies one day and I love when they come back for visits with their families!  Thank goodness for social media because I love keeping up with my youngins after they leave my nest!</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q3:&nbsp;<em>What do you usually do with your student(s) for fun?</em> </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> My husband and I have three teenagers so we are always active with school and community events.  We try to visit as many states in our region with our students.  New Orleans is always a fun trip!  Cajun food and pralines are always a hit!!</em></p>
<p><strong>Q4: <em>Any great stories you want to share?</em></strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>We have been blessed with some awesome students and it's hard to pick one story.  The one that stands out the most is when our son won the Geography Bee at school because he knew the capital of Brazil since our student at the time was from Sao Paulo!</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q5: <em>Any Advice for other host families?</em></strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> Communication is the key to a successful exchange.  These kids are a part of your family and need love and understanding just as much as your biological kids do.  Invest in your relationship with your student and they will become a life-long family member.</em></p>

<strong>Happy Holidays!</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Exchange Holiday Traditions!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The holiday season is one of the most exciting times of the year for host families and their exchange students.  Students are off from school and get to spend more time with their host families.  They also often get the opportunity to meet many of your relatives and other out-of town guests.  You&rsquo;ll of course want to share your holiday traditions with your student and they also may have traditions from their home countries they want to share with you. <br />
  You should also keep in mind that since the holidays are a family time, students may  have a bout of &ldquo;holiday homesickness&rdquo; since they are far from their natural family.  This is not uncommon and the best way to help your student is to keep them involved with your family&rsquo;s activities and make sure your student is not spending excessive amounts of time contacting family and friends at home.</p>

<p><strong>Five month students returning home and Convalidations</strong></p>
<p>It may seem like they just arrived, but students on the fall semester program may soon be leaving.  While these departures can be emotionally trying, the bonds you&rsquo;ve built over your time together will be long-lasting.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve hosted a semester student from Brazil, Ecuador, Italy, Spain or Mexico, you may have already heard them mention something about a &ldquo;convalidation&rdquo;.  A convalidation is an official certification of a student&rsquo;s transcript that they will need to present to their home school in order to get credit for the classes they took in the US.  </p>
<p>It is the students&rsquo; responsibility to take care of their own convalidation process, but they may need your help in securing some of the documents since they will often have to return home before their transcript is available.  Usually, the host family just needs to forwardg the notarized transcript to the exchange student. </p>
<p> The convalidation process varies from country to country and links to the process are here:<br />
  Brazil<a href="../pdf/convalidation/Brazil-Convalidation.pdf"> << view >></a><br />
Ecuador <a href="../pdf/convalidation/Ecuador-Convalidation.pdf"> << view >></a><br />
Italy <a href="../pdf/convalidation/Italy-Convalidation.pdf"> << view >></a><br />
Mexico <a href="../pdf/convalidation/Mexioc-Convalidation.pdf"> << view >></a><br />
Spain<a href="../pdf/convalidation/Spain-Convalidation.pdf"> << view >></a></p>
<p> (<em>If your student requires a convalidation and is not from one of the countries listed above, please contact your ISE Area Representative</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Participating in Winter Sports:</strong>&nbsp; Many of our students will experience their first snowfall here in the U.S. and may want to try winter sports.   Please make sure that students have sport-appropriate clothing and safety gear.  Recreational downhill skiing, snowboarding, skating, sledding and cross country skiing are all covered winter sports on the Insurance plan.   However, snowmobiling is covered only if the student is a passenger and exchange students should never operate a motorized vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Holiday Travel: </strong>School vacations and holidays are upon us and some families are planning vacations with their exchange student.  Please notify your ISE Area Representative if you will be taking your exchange student out of town.  </p>
<p>If your vacation plans include <strong>international travel</strong>, it is critical that you contact your representative well in advance of your trip.  In order to travel internationally, your exchange student will need to get their travel authorization signed on their US entry documents (DS-2019).  We&rsquo;ll also need to confirm that the student has a multiple entry visa.  Failure to obtain this signature can create substantial problems upon your return to the US and it could mean that your exchange student might not be allowed to return to the US.  Please also keep in mind that the exchange student&rsquo;s insurance does not cover international travel so they should secure a policy before they travel.  There are many online travel insurance providers that offer reasonably-priced policies.</p>
