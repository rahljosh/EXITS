<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong></p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to once again thank everybody for the wonderful job they did in placing all of our Fall students well ahead of the scheduled due date. The early completion of placements not only eliminates a great deal of the August stress and craziness, it strengthens  ISE&rsquo;s reputation in the exchange  industry and among the international representatives as an exchange sponsor of the highest quality whose representatives can be counted on to place all of their students on a timely basis.</p>
<p>In addition, as we complete the placing of our Spring students, I would like to congratulate our field on the seamless fashion in which they adapted to the change which requires having an approved host family application prior to the &ldquo;matching&rdquo; of a student to a host family. </p>
<p>I know many of you have already begun speaking to and securing host families for our Fall 2014 arriving students. Please be advised that we have received a number of applications from our international representatives and they are being reviewed and will be disseminated to the field as quickly as possible so you may start placing and begin your journey to London!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
