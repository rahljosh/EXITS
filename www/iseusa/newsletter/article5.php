<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em> <strong>A:</strong> I grew up in Bohemia, Long Island.  I graduated from Binghamton University in 2005 with a B.S. in Financial Economics.  In 2012, I received my Executive MBA in Business Management.  I’m a sports fanatic and borderline insane when it comes to hockey.  I love staying active whether it is playing a quick pick up game or just simply going to the gym.  I love music and  can listen to almost any genre as long as the artist is talented! I play the saxophone, a little guitar, and am currently teaching myself the keyboards.  This coming June will be my 8th year working for International Student Exchange.  I recently just bought a place in Babylon, so I’m loving the 2 minute commute to work every morning!</em></p>

<p><strong>Q: What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>The most challenging task is staying organized due to the wide array of responsibilities.  Most of what I do might be considered back office, so the less you “see” or “hear” about me, the better things are!</em></p>

<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don't know about you. </strong></p>
