<h1>Message from the President</h1>
<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="../images/wayne.jpg" width="224" height="161" alt="Comliance Photo" /></div>
<p>Greetings,<br /><br />
It is hard to believe that those of us in the world of exchange are entering a &quot;new era&quot; of student exchange. But we are and we are winning!!</p>
<p>We have all noticed a marked difference with the birth of compliance. From the newly created compliance team busily checking applications and backgrounds to the IT team creating programs daily to help us operate on a higher level. Placements are being done quicker and managers appear to be taking on more responsibility to ensure that their reps are making qualitative placements in a timely manner. We are even making greater strides with our overseas partners, helping them to understand all of the changes and how this will improve everyone&rsquo;s operations. For those managers and agents that did not wish to change, we thanked them and moved on. Thankfully, the huge majority took on the challenge of these changes and moved forward.</p>
<p>The key component to all of the changes in the last few years is to remember our mission and why we do this wonderful work. We want to make sure that we are indeed &quot;educating tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders&quot; and enabling our families and schools to understand the many differences and similarities among the various people and cultures of the world. We continue to make great strides in checking out all interested hosts with the help of the many changes while making quality placements at a much faster pace than ever. Our office and our field are dedicated to making this our best year ever in our 31 year existence. This challenge combined with a watchful eye on our mission statements will make sure that ISE will continue to be a leader in the field of student exchange.</p>
<p>We are proud of the many changes that we have made to date and the difference they have made within our organization. We are already making plans for the coming year and the continuance of the &quot;new era&quot; of student exchange. We owe everyone a sincere thanks for helping ISE move forward in such a positive manner. We look forward to another great year ahead.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Yesteryear', cursive;">Wayne Brewer</h2>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<p>The online application has been going very well. We want to thank you for all your support and patience in making this a successful transition. The new application has significantly sped up the approval process and most applications are approved the first time through the compliance process. This has allowed the Compliance team to maintain a consistent 24-hour turnaround, with many applications being approved the same day they are received.</p>
<p>What slows down the process is when the application has missing or inconsistent information and then needs to go back to the Area Rep to clarify an issue. While it may seem that these issues are small, we are subject to review and audit by the US Department of State and they pay attention to every detail in the application, <strong><u class="red">no matter how small</u></strong>. That means that even if the placement is with a wonderful family and a great school, we can be cited because we were missing a photograph or because of an incomplete answer to a question.<br /></p>
  <h3>The most common issues we find are:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Inconsistent information in the application &#8211; especially around children and pets.
<p style="padding-top: 10px;"><strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>The application lists no pets, but the family letter says &quot;we love playing with our three dogs&quot; or the family album has a family photo where they are holding a cat or dog.</li>
    <li>The host family application lists the pet information; however the Confidential Host Family Visit Form either lists no pets or incorrect pet information.</li>
    <li>The application will say that the exchange student will not be sharing a room, but the family has a three bedroom home and five children.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>References &#8211; improper or incomplete references</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>References must be from people that live in the community or general vicinity of the host family</li>
    <li>Missing answers &#8211; especially question 3 &#8211; &quot;Characteristics of the Home&quot;. Consider answers like, &quot;the home is neat and clean&quot; or &quot;inviting home&quot; or &quot;kids love visiting their home&quot; or &quot;happy home environment&quot;, etc.</li>
  </ul></li></ul>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Double placement &#8211; we need either:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos for the two bedrooms for the exchange students</li>
    <li>Photo of two beds in the bedroom</li>
  </ul></li></ul>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Photos</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos must be clear and the rooms should be tidy </li>
    <li>Host family photos should only contain the family members. Photos showing extra people will be questioned to ensure they were not left off the application.</li>
    <li>Photos should not be dated and must be current.</li>
  </ul></li></ul>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Incomplete or inaccurate </strong><strong>school acceptance forms</strong><strong> </strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Missing school contact title and email address, website and school dates.</li>
    <li>Errors in the student's DOB, incorrect spelling of host family names, addresses and the student's name.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>As we all know, we are headed for crunch time and hope these tips help you to submit complete applications so that you can meet all placement and bonus deadlines.</p>
<p>Please also note that per Department of State regulations, the host family orientation must occur <strong><u class="red">after</u></strong> the completion of the application by the host family&nbsp;and <strong><u class="red">prior</u></strong> to the student's arrival.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, the Compliance Department email address is <a href="mailto:compliance@iseusa.com">compliance@iseusa.com</a>.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="../images/Facilitator_sq.jpg" width="430" height="215" /></div>
<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>

<p>With  the move to the on-line application and the creation of the compliance  department, the role of facilitator has transitioned to become a field  support role and the primary point of contact for the field to the New  York office. If you have a question about an application, payment,  student support issue, or any other question, call or email your  facilitator and they will get you an answer.</p>
<p>I's  also very important to make sure that your region is prepared for the  year. Below is a checklist of items that your reps, host families and  students need to double check.</p>

<p><strong>Registering for high school: </strong>Make sure your student takes care of all your school's requirements for registration. They will likely require proof of vaccination/immunization documentation and other documentation.</p>

<p><strong>ISE Insurance Info:</strong> Please  go over all insurance information with your student when they arrive so  that you are prepared in case of emergency. Visit the insurance website  to find a list of local doctors that they can use, perhaps the same one  as the host family.</p>

<p><strong>Important Documents:</strong> Keeping important documents (visa, passport, etc) in a safe place that the host family is aware of in case of an emergency. The insurance card should stay with the student at all times and a copy needs to be with the host family and maybe even the area rep.</p>

<p><strong>Communication:</strong> Encourage the host family to contact the area rep, no matter how big or small the issue. The area rep should be aware of the little things because sometimes they turn into big things.</p>

<p><strong>First Day of School:</strong> Ask a guidance counselor to assign your student a buddy for the day to show them around school or to sit with him/her at lunch. Encourage your student(s) to get involved in activities early on in order to make friends and adjust more quickly. When choosing classes make sure students are taking an English and American History course as well as two other academic classes. It is good to balance out the heavily academic courses with some lighter elective courses as well. Be sure to find out if there is a class that your student needs to take in order to receive credit back home.</p>

<p><strong>Establish House Rules:</strong> Make sure your families establish rules and expectations with their exchange student early on. Review ISE rules and program policies in the ISE student handbook. Focus on key issues of concern, curfews, chores, internet and phone usage, getting around, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Many students go through feelings of homesickness when they arrive and experience highs and lows in their first few weeks or months. Your host families will also notice adjustment issues as they take on a new family member.</p>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3>Maryah Nardone - Facilitator</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I received my bachelor's degree in Physical Education, and Master's degree in Health Education. &nbsp;I was the Athletic Director, physical education teacher at Bard High School Early College in Manhattan for 5 years. &nbsp; </em></p>
<p class="grey"><em>I love playing sports, games, and being active. I play beach volleyball during the summer, and basketball during the school year. I love canjam and any other game that involves a Frisbee. &nbsp; </em></p>
<p class="grey"><em>I also love reading, traveling, spending time with my (very large) family, entertaining, and knitting. Yes... knitting.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your job function in ISE?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> Since I've started at ISE (in September 2012), I have been a facilitator. &nbsp;As a facilitator, I assist the field and international agents with any issues, questions, or concerns regarding students on program. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="grey"><em>The other positions I hold at ISE are: Plant Whisper and General Green Thumb, Bring-er of Snacks and Foods to Try for the Office, and NYO Social Coordinator (none of these are paid positions but just as gratifying). ;-)&nbsp; </em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> One of the most challenging aspects of this job is the time zones... many times requests or inquiries are sent to our oversea partners and we often have to wait at least 24 hours for a response. &nbsp;Also, the limited face to face contact that we have with the field, agents, and students makes building a relationship and rapport difficult. &nbsp; </em></p>
<p class="grey"><em>The most satisfying has to be the people that I work with... the NY office, the Regional Managers and regions, and the International Agents. I love meeting and talking to people from different places and walks of life. Despite the limited face-time, being able to work with all of you amazing people around the US and world has opened my eyes to so many places I can only hope to visit and experience in person. </em>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don&rsquo;t know about you. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I am going to be an aunt for the first time! Baby Nardone is expected to arrive February 15th, and I am so excited already! &nbsp;</em></p>
<p class="grey"><em>Also, I share my birthday with my grandma, 2 cousins (from different sides of the family), and best friend. &nbsp;May 19th is the best day ever.</em> &nbsp; </p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What new projects are you going to be working on this year?</strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I would really love to be more actively involved in training new reps and agents. I love teaching and really miss that. I'd love to be able to incorporate more of my teaching and administrative skills to any and all aspects of ISE.</em></p>
