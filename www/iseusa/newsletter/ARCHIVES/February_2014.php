<h1>What about Bob!</h1>
<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="../images/bob-news.png" width="225" height="150" alt="Happy Holidays from ISE" /></div>

<p>As we move rapidly in to the Fall placing season, it is an opportune time to reflect and remind ourselves of some of the far reaching benefits of the program and the wonderful work you perform.</p> 
<p>First and foremost, our mission, bringing the world closer one student at a time. Students living abroad are a key element in a global society.</p>
<p>Our students, host families, schools and communities are exposed fresh ideas, different cultures and learn firsthand about the customs and cultures of other countries.</p>
<p>Student exchange is a vehicle for cross cultural understanding, a key component of peace and diplomacy.</p> 
<p>Student exchange creates lifelong friendships and helps students from around the world gain a new perspective on the United States.</p>
<p>International student exchange is an educational tool that benefits all students who share their classroom or school with an international visitor.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for all you do and your dedication to student exchange!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<p>The quality of the content in the host family application and supporting documents has improved tremendously and there are just a couple areas we can still use a little more attention.  Getting these items right will ensure the fastest possible processing of your host family applications.</p> 

<h3>HOST FAMILY APPLICATION:</h3>

<H4>Personal Description</H4> 

<p>As the application states, the personal description is one of the most important parts of the application.  It introduces the family to the student and establishes the initial bond between them.  The description should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intro of why the family wants to host.</li>
<li>Intro of each family member with a couple of sentences Other details or interesting facts about the family.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Here is an example of a good letter:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>Carl and I are faith and family focused and are blessed to have healthy, well-rounded children who understand the importance of service in our community. Our family loves to spend time together supporting each other’s interests such as acting, drawing, soccer, basketball, and any other inspiring projects.</i></p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>Carl works at a local steel mill providing for his family.  He is also an assistant coach for the high school girl’s soccer team.  He volunteers a lot at the local homeless shelter (where I work) and is a youth group leader at our church.  His passion is cooking.  He loves to cook, especially old family recipes. </i></p> 

<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>I (Lily) was lucky to follow my dream of making a living by serving others.  I currently work at a local non-profit whose focus is to provide safe housing for homeless and food through a food pantry.  I am also a youth leader at our church as well as the committee chair for the Peace and Social Justice group.  I also sit on a county wide committee to end homelessness in our county.</i></p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>Our oldest son, Kyle, is 23 and lives independently in Burlington, which is close to our town of Essex.  He is enrolled in culinary school and works at a local restaurant as a cook.  Our son, Jacob, is 18 and a senior at Essex High School.  He dreams of attending an art school after he graduates.  He enjoys playing soccer and currently works part-time at a local fast food restaurant.  Our 3rd son Brad, is 16 and is very active in our church youth group.  He plays basketball and soccer through the school.  Our youngest son Peter, is 14 and lives for soccer!  He plays year-round for a premier league and also very active in the church youth group.</i></p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>We are a smoke-free home and encourage our children to be leaders in our community by living a positive lifestyle and being an example for others.</i></p>  

<p style="margin-left: 25px"><i>We love to learn about other cultures, religions and geographic areas.  We are interested in hosting an exchange student to share our culture and learn about theirs.  We hope to be a welcoming home and a safe place to give a visitor to the U.S. the best experience while they are here.</i></p>

<h4>Family Album</h4>

<p>All photos must be original photographs.  Since you have to visit the home anyway, please bring a camera with you and take a photo of the host family members and home during your visit.  This will ensure that you have current photos.  Photos that are older than one year will be rejected.</p>

<p>The home photos must show tidy rooms and make sure they include the entire detail of room.  For example, a bathroom photo should not just show a toilet.  Sometimes this is hard to do with one photo so please take multiple photos if necessary during your visit to make sure you capture all aspects of each room.</p>

<h4>References</h4>

<p>References cannot be relatives.  They must have visited the family inside of their home and they must live in the same community or general vicinity of the host family.</p>

<p>If a reference listed is not in the same town as the host family, the Compliance team will calculate the distance from the town host family resides to the town of the reference.  If the reference is more than an hour away from the host family, we will have to request another reference.</p>  

<h3>HOST FAMILY ORIENTATIONS:</h3>

<p>The DOS rules state "sponsors must conduct the host family orientation at the end of the family application process, i.e., after the host family has been fully vetted and accepted into the program."</p>  

<p>This means the orientation must take place after the Compliance team has approved the host family application.  Therefore, the date of the orientation must be after the application HQ approval date to be compliant.  Orientations with non-compliant dates will not be accepted and will hold up supervision payments.  Due to the volume of orientations, we cannot notify each rep of a non-compliant orientation.</p>  
<h3>SCHOOL ACCEPTANCE:</h3>

<p>We are still receiving school acceptances missing information.  If there is a question on the form, there must be a answer (this is what the DOS has told us).  The most common issues are:</p>
<ul><li>host family and school complete address  (street,  town, state, zip code)</li>
<li>host family email address missing</li>
<li>school website missing</li>
<li>school contact title missing</li>
<li>school beginning and end date</li></ul>
<p>Submitting an incomplete or inaccurate school acceptance will hold up a student's placement and the placement payment to the area rep.</p>
<h3>DOUBLE PLACEMENTS</h3>
<p>Due to the question in the 14/15 host family application on the Hosting Environment page regarding the host family's option to host two students, we no longer require a host family double placement document.  By selecting "Yes, I would like to host a second student", that is the approval.</p>

<div style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="../images/Facilitator-names.png" width="430" height="264" /></div>
<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>
<p><strong>Dear ISE Area Reps:</strong></p>
<p>The Fall 2014 placement season is in full swing and we have a number of bonuses that are available for placements at this time.  The bonuses include the following and check out the flyers for specific details:</p>
<p><strong>Winter CEO Bonus:</strong> $300 for new placements made from Feb 5 – Feb 28</p>
<p><strong>Pre-AYP Bonus:</strong> $250-$200-$150 sliding scale bonus for Pre-AYP students</p>
<p><strong>LAB Bonus:</strong> $50 Additional Pre-AYP bonus for LAB – China students</p>
<p><strong>State preference bonus:</strong> $60 bonus for placing a student in their preferred state</p>
<p><strong>Fast Track Bonus:</strong> $300-$200-$100 sliding scale bonus for groups of five students.  For example, if you place 5 students prior to April 28, you can earn a $300 bonus for <u>each</u> student.</p>
<h3>Payment questions</h3>
<p>We often get question from Area Reps about why they didn’t receive a payment.  Nine times out of ten, the answer is that some required document is missing.  If you have completed a progress report or submitted a placement and haven’t been paid yet, please check the following items before contacting your Regional Manager or the ISE office.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Reports:</strong> The progress report needs to be approved by your regional manager and facilitator before it will be paid.  Additionally, all documentation must be received and approved by the ISE office before a payment is made.  Make sure that the student and host family orientations are complete, especially when a student moves to a new host family.</p>
<p><strong>Placement Payments:</strong> Placements are paid when the placement has been approved by the ISE home office and all documentation has been submitted and approved.  The most frequent cause of payment delay is a missing school acceptance.  Please make sure that these are submitted so you can ensure the fastest payment processing.</p>
<p><strong>Timing: </strong> Checks are cut each Monday and Thursday and are typically sent out the following day.  If you complete a progress report or submit an application, please keep in mind the approval time as well as the mailing time for the check.  So if you submit a missing school acceptance on Monday, it will probably take a week or more before you receive a check.</p> 
<p><strong>Status:</strong> If you ever want to check the status of a payment, you can look up your payments in EXITS.  Select “Users → My Information” from the menu bar and scroll down to “Payment Activity”.  If you click on the “view details” link, it will give you access to your payment history.  Note that in some cases you may see a payment date in the future.  That means that a check is forthcoming on that date.</p>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3><strong>Tom Policastro</strong>&#8211; <strong>Project Manager</strong></h3>
<div style="margin: 10px; width: 235px; float: right;"><img src="../images/tomEmployee.png" width="235" alt=""/></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em> <strong>A:</strong> I grew up on Long Island, with all of my formative years worth writing about spent in sometimes painfully uninteresting suburb of Miller Place. I kept busy honing a jump shot, running the school’s drama program, and playing music with good friends. I studied professional writing at York College of Pennsylvania, with most of my extra circulars being music based. After a brief respite in Lancaster, PA post grad, found my way back to Long Island’s sandy shores.  I spent just about a year to the day working in customer service for a local grocery store and playing gigs by night when time allowed. I then came across an ad in the paper for a position with ISE and, as the saying goes, the rest is history.  In my spare time I still make music when I can, but a lot more casually than I used to. I sing vocals primarily, though, I do dabble with the ukulele, but "good look" getting me to strum that in public. I play basketball, read, and write quite a bit, (plays, short fiction, album reviews, etc.). I keep pretty busy and my needs are few. As long as there’s good people and laughter around, I’m pretty easily contented. </em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your job function in ISE?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I’m a Project Manager for ISE, which having not yet been through I full cycle in student exchange, I still find a bit difficult to properly, or at the very least, concisely define. I will say that a lot of my day to day obligations entail collaborating with our International Agents and making sure their questions are answered and needs are met. I wind up planning a lot of events and trips, not the least of which being our “Celebration of Success,” which is one of my few opportunities to work with and get to know the field. The program that I manage and have worked hard to revamp a bit is our Outbound Program, which I look forward to continuing to help grow. My job description kind of changes with the seasons and renders me a Jack of a great many things and a master of very few. With that said, so far, I enjoy the unique diversity this job offers and I’m learning a ton about this ever-evolving industry by the day. I’m never bored, always on my toes, and I appreciate the variety of skills sets that this job allows you to cultivate. </em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>Sometimes the ever-changing landscape of my job description feels a bit more like a curse than a blessing, but as I said, I’d much prefer the excitement to monotony. I would say the biggest challenge of my job, or adjustment I’ve had to make as a professional, is something I think we can all relate to in this business. My biggest adjustment by far has been adapting to this 24/7 kind of industry. I’m no stranger to hard work and in my heart I’d never be fulfilled at a job that didn’t require my full attention and effort, but it was pretty jarring at first to realize just how much this industry’s expectations clashed with the traditional 9 to 5. I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s something I’m “used to” by now, but it’s certainly a facet of the job I’ve come to expect and I take great pride in rising to that challenge. What that lone aspect of student exchange has taught me about myself has been invaluable. What I adore about this job is how tangible the results are. There are so many occupations out there where people bust their hump and might not get the chance to see the fruits of their labor. ISE appears to function in exactly the opposite way. When you take on a project, you get the chance to see it through to the end and the results are empirical and intensely gratifying. As cliché as it sounds we help young people see the world and better their lives beyond their time abroad and often we have the chance to get to know these kids along the way.  A mission statement like that makes the tough days worth it, I find.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don't know about you. </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I’d like to believe we’re all a little deeper than we seem.  I suppose in my case the music and writing ventures take people by surprise.  I used to gig a bit more and my creative writing has been published a few times, just not enough to fill a bank account just yet.  I used to freelance for a few PA based websites about NBA basketball, but I no longer really have the time to invest in breaking all that stuff down like a used to.  I will say that my dream job would be to become a writer for Sesame Street.  I reckon that would fall under the “fun fact” category.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What new projects are you going to be working on this year?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>The Outbound Program is one of the few year-round constants for which I’m responsible.  I look forward to building that facet of ISE up again.  I have made great strides in cleaning up and organizing the program. The re-designed website has also helped usher in this new era for Outbound. The bottom line is I still have so much to learn about Outbound and student exchange as a whole, but if there’s one thing I’ve proven in my brief time here it’s that I care about ISE and a bit more selfishly, what the quality of my work says about my character. I look forward to growing with ISE and returning the favor by helping ISE grow and excel wherever and whenever I can.</em></p>
