<h1>Message from the President</h1>
<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="../images/wayne.jpg" width="224" height="161" alt="Comliance Photo" /></div>
<p>On Monday, October 7th, I had the pleasure of honoring the founders of International Student Exchange, Barbara and Bob Fink.</p>
<p>Accepting the award was Julie Maes, Bob's sister and current ISE Manager. Bob and Barbara founded the company in 1982 and Julie started her managerial career as well in that year. Bob was unable to accept the award personally due to Barbara's recent passing.</p>
<p>Bob and Barbara were host parents on several occasions prior to starting ISE in 1982. They were not happy with the exchange company from which their students came and decided that they could do better. They felt that if the exchange program was designed to bring people of the world closer together, than it had to be operated in a qualitative manner.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, ISE is proud to state that it still maintains the same mission that Bob and Barbara put forth and its J-1 Secondary School Program still maintains the high level and spirit that its founders demanded in 1982.</p>
<p>ISE is very proud and grateful for the vision and devotion of its two founders.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<p>Give a big welcome to Jessica, who joined our team on Friday Oct 4th.</p>
<p>Jessica has a background as a paralegal and comes to us after working for several years in a law office. Her enthusiasm, attention to detail and experience researching issues will be an asset to the team. Jessica is bilingual in Spanish and Italian. The Compliance Department now consists of Merri, Lisa and Jessica. </p>
<p>We have been receiving many host family and student orientations and processing them as quickly as possible. If you have not sent yours in yet, please do so as this will hold up supervision payments. We are still getting many non-compliant orientations. Remember, the host family orientation must occur and be dated prior to the student's arrival but after the host family application was completed. The student's orientation must occur and be dated after the student has arrived.</p>
<p>It appears second home visits are well under way. Please be sure to keep an eye on the due dates of the visits not completed yet. We realize this new procedure of comparing the 1st visit report to the 2nd visit report, although extremely important, is frustrating to some. As time goes on, this too will become easier.</p>

<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>
<h2>Communication is the Key!</h2>
<h3 style="color: #000;">Notify your Regional Manager of <span class="red"><u>All</u></span> student issues, no matter how small</h3>
<p>With the year well underway, most of our students are adapting well to their homes, communities, and schools and new language. For those that are still having challenges we want to remind everyone that is <u>very important</u> that you <u>notify your Regional Manager (RM)</u> of any problems your student(s) may be experiencing. Your RM will then help determine the best course of action and will also report these incidents back to the home office.</p>
<p>Knowing what is happening early on is critically important. In the home office, we often see situations where the first thing we hear is a host family saying that they want a student "sent home" or a student is being dismissed from school and we've never heard of any incident in the home. We contact the RM who's also heard nothing. They then contact the Area Rep who says that the student has been misbehaving for weeks or months. In those cases, it limits our options since we have not gone through the proper warnings to the student or notifications to the agent and natural family It's only fair to give the student a chance in these cases and when we haven't lived up to our responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Please do not contact or communicate with natural family members or relatives</strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that while you are working directly with a student in your area, that student has natural parents and a foreign agent that need to be made aware of the progress or their child. That is the responsibility of the ISE home office and our international agents. <strong>Please do not communicate with the natural parents</strong>. While you think you may just be trying to help out the situation, our home office and foreign partners are in the best position to manage communication with parents from different cultures. If a natural parent contacts you, please tell them to contact their international agent. This is something they agree to this in their contract and it assures that the situation is being dealt with appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Do not move students until the new family is approved by the home office</strong></p>
<p>There nothing more embarrassing and unprofessional than telling an agent or natural family that ISE does not know where there child is staying. It undercuts our credibility with our natural families and our international partners. Additionally, United States Department of State regulations only allow placement after the host family has been fully vetted and their application has been approved by the home office. Students can be moved only after the new family application has been approved by the home office.</p>
<p>In emergencies, students should be moved into your home, or into the home of an existing <u>vetted</u> host family. Even in these emergency situations you must <strong>immediately notify</strong> your RM. Call them on your way over to pick up the student so that your RM can then inform the home office of the move. The home office will then notify our international agent and the natural family.</p>
<p><strong>Monthly Progress Reports</strong></p>
<p>Monthly progress reports are a key tool in keeping the natural family aware of how well their child is progressing on the program. They should be done each month and don't just wait until the "payment" month. Keep in mind that we do share these reports with the family so please provide detailed responses to each question. Responses should be <u>paragraph length</u> and provide detail and examples. Use professional language and proper grammar and spelling.</p>
<p>Please also make sure the report reflects what is really happening in the home. If there are issues, share them in the report. It often happens that we get an email from an Area Rep about a student failing school or having significant host family issues. When we look at the progress report, it says "student is doing well in school"; and "getting along well with host family."</p>
<p><strong>Change in payment process</strong></p>
<p>Starting this week, we'll implement a new payment process for progress reports and second visit payments. Payments will be made on a weekly basis for all supervision reports that are completed in the previous seven days. Checks will be cut every Wednesday and you'll receive a report of all progress report and second visit payments each Thursday. Payments will be made only when the home office has received ALL required documentation, including orientation paperwork. If there are payments that you feel are missing from that report, please review EXITS to ensure that all paperwork has been received. If it has, and you still haven't been paid for an item, contact your RM who will then follow-up with the home office.</p>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3><strong>Meagan O'Connor </strong> - Facilitator</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; width: 208px; float: right;"><img src="../images/employee_oct.png" width="208" height="202" /></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I grew up in Levittown, NY, where I currently still live. I graduated in August 2012 from Marist College with a degree in Public Relations as well as a Business minor. I studied abroad in Dublin, Ireland and try to travel there as much as possible as it is where my mom grew up and where a lot of my family lives. I get to go there mostly for Irish Dancing, which I have been competitively involved in since I was 3 years old. It's still a huge part of my life and is where  I spend most of my nights after work! My father's side of my background is Native American.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your job function in ISE?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I am a Student Services Facilitator. I deal mainly in student issues and speak back and forth a lot with International Agents and Regional Managers. It is my job to work out any concerns a student may have and to ensure that they get the most out of their program.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I think the most challenging thing is that there is very rarely a &quot;black and white&quot; situation going on. It takes a lot of analyzing and sorting through details to reach an answer and solution that works. Although a challenge, doing so definitely increases what I feel is the most satisfying part of the job. When I can find a solution that helps out a student and improves his/her program, all the work is definitely worth it.  </em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don't know about you. </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I have a very large family. I have four brothers and three sisters (yes, that is 7 siblings!) all ranging in ages 9-30. I absolutely love it and wouldn't have it any other way.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What new projects are you going to be working on this year?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I'm not sure about new "projects", but I am really excited that facilitators are going to be speaking more with students. When I interned at an exchange school in Ireland, I worked first hand with the students and it's something I really loved. I like the idea of giving students more people to talk to and I really enjoy listening to them tell me about their experiences so far. </em></p>
