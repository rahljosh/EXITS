<h3>A New Beginning</h3>
<p>One of the nicest things about being involved in student exchange is that each and every September brings forth a new season.  Of course, it is wonderful to greet the students, watch the relationships grow, and to see all of the work you put forth start to blossom at school and with the host families.  But to be able to start the process all over is something most work and projects don't have the capability of doing.</p>

<p>I have always encouraged early September to be the best time to make those lists of things to do such as reports, supervision, activities, and of course preparing for the new season ahead.  It is always a great time to look back and see what can be improved upon and make those changes.  September is the perfect time to enjoy the students and their families and to help out those who are in need of extra time and counseling to make those necessary adjustments.  I have always told myself that I need September not only to get myself organized and prepared but it has always given me the positive impetus to go forward and try and find those families for the coming January and August seasons.  When we see all of the wonderful and positive results of our work, it should motivate us to even want to do better.</p>
<p>To find an experience where you can start all over each year is rather unique.  Take advantage of this and commit yourself to a wonderful new season.  To be able to bring people of the world together and help the leaders of tomorrow grow, just adds to the fresh start that September brings us.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<p>The Compliance Department put in many long hours throughout the month of August and the beginning of September to insure all online applications and school acceptances were reviewed as quickly as possible. ISE has done an <strong>excellent job</strong> with placement paperwork this year. All applications are in and we're just waiting for a handful of missing items.</p>

<p>
Thank you to all the field staff for your hard work in getting the host families to complete their online applications. We especially appreciated how responsive everyone was when we had a quick question or needed additional detail to finalize approval of the application.</p>
<p>We have been receiving many host family orientations and student orientations. It is important to remember the host family orientation must be done before the student arrives and dated as such and the student orientation is of course done after the student arrives and dated after arrival. This may seem like something that is too obvious to point out, but we often see incorrect dates on the orientations.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier this year, the second visit report processing and payments will be automated. Compliance will be reviewing these reports and once they approve them, payments will automatically be generated. The detail in the second visit report will be compared to the Confidential Visit Report (aka the host family visit report) and if there are discrepancies, compliance will be contacting you for clarification.</p>
<p>With all the students arriving and adjusting to their new surroundings, there will of course be some situations where the placement does not work out and we need to relocate a student. If this happens, please make sure that he facilitator is notified prior to any move decision being made. Please also keep in mind that regulations require us to fully vet the new host family prior to the student being moved so please get any new relocation family to complete a new online application. However, if a student is being moved to a host family that has already been approved for the 13/14 season, no new application is required.</p>
<p>As always, if there are urgent situations where an application needs to be reviewed immediately, please let the Compliance Department know. We can usually turn these applications around within an hour, assuming all the documentation is completed.</p>

<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>

<p>With the start of a new program, we want to remind everyone of a few key items.</p>
<p><strong>Host Family Rules</strong><br />
  Make sure your host families establish clear Host Family rules. These should be written down and discussed with the student. Key issues to address include:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Curfew and contact</li>
  <li>Inviting friends over</li>
  <li>Food and special food issues/costs</li>
  <li>Internet usage</li>
  <li>Phone use and charges &#8211; We recommend that families not include exchange students on their family cell phone plan. This has resulted      in significant charges and problems between families and students in the past when texting, long distance and data usage bills come in.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Communication</strong></p>
<ul><li>Make sure your host families know who you are and when to contact you. Many host families, especially those who have not hosted before, don't clearly understand the role of the local area representative. Frequent reminders that you are their main point of contact and ensuring the family has all your contact details can help prevent small issues from growing.</li><br />
<li>Strongly encourage the host family to keep you in the loop on every issue, no matter how small. More often than not, big issues relate to a series of small issues and if they are addressed early on, the larger issues can be avoided.</li><br />
<li>Keep in touch with your students via in-person visits, email, phone, text or other means. Be careful to listen to them and allow them to fully express their feelings and avoid jumping to conclusions. Ask open ended questions. For example:<br />
  <br />
<ul type="disc">
  <li>If a student is      having issues with a host sibling ask questions such as:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>How's your relationship with your family? </li>
    <li>How are you getting  along with (ask about each member of the family)?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>If they mention an      issue, ask questions such as</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Why do you think that happened?</li>
    <li>What do you think you can do to make the       situation better?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Avoid "leading"questions like:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>I hear you are having problems with . . . ?</li>
    <li>Do you want to be       here &#8211; with this family &#8211; in the US &#8211; On the program?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>These questions can come off as threats, will make students nervous and will prevent you from      understanding the true issues.</li>
</ul></li></ul>
<p>Keep up on your progress reports. We&rsquo;ll be tracking the completion of progress reports and automating the payment process. <br />
  </p>
<p>Please follow the chain of communication:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Host Family &#187; Area Representative &#187; Regional Advisor/Regional Manger &#187; Home Office &#187; Agent -- We understand that this chain is somewhat long and you may not get      always get answers as quickly as you would like, but skipping steps in      this chain causes more issues than it solves.</li>
  <li>Make sure HF know who      to contact with questions/issues</li>
  <li>Make sure HF and      student have AR contact info</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Insurance</strong><br />
  Students on the ISE high school program are covered under an insurance plan issued by Global Secutive and claims are managed by United Healthcare. Please take a moment to visit the Global Secutive website (<a href="http://www.esecutive.com">www.esecutive.com</a>) and review options for doctors in your area. Please also identify a local urgent care clinic. While all communities do not have urgent care clinics, it is usually a more preferable option than an emergency room as the service usually happens faster and students aren&rsquo;t subject to special emergency room visit charges. Urgent care clinics can usually treat sprains, broken bones, minor cuts and burns and other non-life threatening situations and emergency rooms are better suited for significant injury, breathing difficulties and other significant emergency health concerns. Please contact the ISE office if you have any insurance questions at <a href="tel:800.766.4656" target="_blank">800.766.4656</a>. Please have your student make a copy of their insurance card and keep the copy in a safe place and make sure the student keeps the card with them at all times.</p>
  <P style="padding: 10px; background-color: #EFEFEF; text-align: center;"><strong>Global Secutive:</strong> <a href="http://www.esecutive.com/MyInsurance/">www.esecutive.com/MyInsurance/</a><br />
  <strong>ISE Contact:</strong> 800.766.4656</P>
<p><strong>Language Skill</strong><br />
  If you have a student who is facing challenges with their English ability contact your RM immediately. In many cases if we address this situation early on, we can involve tutors and other support to help resolve this issue.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>Keep Active</strong><br />
  Get students involved in activities at the school and in the community immediately. Don't let them get settled. Get them out of the home and joining clubs, local youth groups, sports teams and other organizations.</p>
<p><u>Issue Documentation and Resolution</u><br />
  If student issues do arise, please make sure you document them via the Problem ID Form (PID), the Problem Resolution form (PRF), and the Notice of Probation (NOP). <br />
</p>
<p><strong>PID </strong>&#8211; the PID is used to document any student issue. It's completed by the Area Rep and sent to your RM and the facilitator. It does not require any signature or necessarily any follow-up.<br />
  </p>
<p><strong>PRF </strong>&#8211; the PRF is used to document a meeting that you have with the student and host family and get honest feedback from the student. It is of the utmost importance that the student provides some feedback, regardless of whether they agree or disagree with the proposed solution. If the student is not comfortable giving feedback to you or the host family, have them send a confidential email to their facilitator. </p>
<p><strong>NOP </strong>&#8211; Notices of probation are used for very serious situations where the student is in jeopardy of being removed from the program. They should be issued only after consultation with the your Regional Manager and the facilitator.</p>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3><strong>James Griffiths </strong> - Software Developer</h3>
<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I was born in Rockville Centre, but lived in Michigan for a few years before my family moved to Babylon in 1999. I went to Stony Brook University where I graduated with a bachelors in Computer Science this past May. I have always had an interest in computers, when I was younger I would take them apart and put them back together and in college I started working more with programming which then became my major (Before computer science I had tried out classes in several majors including electrical engineering, architecture, and business). I spend some of my free time building computers and playing video games, but usually I'll just hang out with my friends.</em><em>.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your job function in ISE?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I am a software developer. I fix problems that come up in our various systems (EXITS, EXTRA, etc.) as well as implement new features and updates to those systems.</em><em>&nbsp; </em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q:&nbsp;What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong>Whenever I am able to fix an issue that has come up in the system. Sometimes those problems are very simple and I am able to fix them in about 5 minutes, other times it will be more complex and can take up to a few days. I also enjoy when I am able to add something to the system that will (hopefully) make someones job easier.&nbsp; </em></p>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don&rsquo;t know about you. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>I enjoy target and clay shooting. It's not something that I do all the time, but probably about once a month I'll go to the range and when I go upstate to my parent's cabin I will usually spend some time shooting.</em>&nbsp; </p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What new projects are you going to be working on this year?</strong> &nbsp; </p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong> I'm not sure about everything, I know that there are a few projects that IT has been holding off on until after this placing season. I do know that we are planning on implementing automatic updates for insurance, figuring out a better way to associate host family applications with seasons to make repeat host families easier to deal with, and some other back-end features to keep better track of the people who update information on the system.</em></p>
