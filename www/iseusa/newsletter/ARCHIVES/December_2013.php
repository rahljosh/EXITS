<h1>The Latest....</h1>

<h2>The Holiday Season is Here!</h2>

<p>There are many things to do over the holidays.  Make sure your host families understand the importance of sharing traditions. Sometimes the most common holiday US traditions might be very new for your exchange students. Make sure your host families make the season fun and exciting! </p>

<div class="hrLine"></div>

<h2>Project HELP</h2>

<p>The holidays are the perfect time to help out.  Get your exchange students to fulfill their Project HELP requirement. Tell them to help out at their local food bank, clothing drive or sign up with one of our national partners.</p>

<h2>Capture Your Activities</h2>

<p>Send us pictures of your students and families on how they celebrate. We want to see Christmas, Kwanzaa and New Year's pictures. If they built a snowman, decorate a tree, made cookies or just hang out, send it all at <a href="#">socialmedia@iseusa.com</a> or message us on our facebook page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iseusa">www.facebook.com/iseusa</a>.</p>

<h1>Message from the President</h1>
<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="images/wayne.jpg" width="224" height="161" alt="Happy Holidays from ISE" /></div>

<p>As the holidays approach, everyone involved in student exchange enjoys the greatest of all seasons. Our mission statement of &quot;bringing people of the world together&quot; is never more obvious than this time of year. The different customs, cultures, traditions and activities present a great example of what we can all learn from each other. Most Americans have never even heard of a German Christmas Market while most Europeans have never seen a typical decorated Christmas tree packed into a home as many people do in the United States.</p>
<p>The exchange experience gives us all the opportunity to gain insights into other people and nationalities. One of the reasons why international diplomacy often does not work is that there is so much basic misunderstanding among different cultures of the world. As we know, our American families often gain as much from the hosting experience as our foreign students. We must learn how other people live and think. It is nice to see how our host families and exchange students have learned to overcome worldwide problems simply through the exchange experience.</p>
<p>So as the holiday season comes upon us, let us all be thankful for this wonderful experience of hosting. Our host families and our foreign students can all enjoy that incredible feeling of being together. They grow to understand, relate and love each other. This is a great time of the year to thank our representatives, our families, schools and our foreign friends for joining together in this most wonderful exchange program.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<h3>Happy Holidays from the Compliance Team!</h3>
<p>We appreciate all the effort you have made to improve the quality of the information in the online applications. We'll  be sending out some updates to the host family application and process in a couple weeks. In the meantime, we thought we'd share with you some  key items to consider as you start recruiting and placing AYP 14/15 and Fall 2014 semester students.</p>
<p><strong>Existing host families </strong>&#8211; If a host family has already completed an eHost application, they just need to refresh their application. This includes:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Updating all photos</li>
  <li>Updating personal description</li>
  <li>Noting any changes to family composition (family members moving out, new additions, moves, etc.)</li>
  <li> Updating any references</li>
  <li>You will still need to do a home visit and host family orientation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Both new and existing host families </strong>&#8211; The following items apply to both new and existing host families: </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The  entire host family must be approved before a student can be placed with  the family. However, you can place a student prior to receiving the  school acceptance form.</li>
  <li>Make  sure that all information in the school acceptance is completed. Missing information delays approval of the placement and requires more  work for everyone. Common issues include:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Missing  or incomplete addresses for the host family and school. Make sure you  have the street address (not a PO Box) for both the family and school.</li>
    <li>Missing school information:</li>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Make sure you get the school contact&rsquo;s title (Principal, Counselor, etc.)</li>
      <li>School website address (e.g. <a href="http://www.yourschool.edu" target="_blank">www.yourschool.edu</a>)</li>
      <li> Include start/end dates for both semesters</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>First  impressions count. The host family photos are included in the host family application that is shared with our agent, exchange student and  his/her natural family.</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Photos must be original photos and not scans of old application photos or pictures of framed photos in the family home.</li>
    <li>Take nice bright photos of the home</li>
    <li>Make sure the rooms in the home are tidy and no people are present</li>
    <li>Get pictures of the family in action (travel, hobbies, events)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Common issues with references:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>References cannot be relatives</li>
    <li>References must have visited the inside of the home</li>
    <li>References must live in the same community or general vicinity of the host family.</li>
  </ul>
  <li> Relocations to a double placement &#8211; please remember to:</li>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>Link the students as a double placement</li>
    <li>Get an additional bedroom/bed photo</li>
    <li>Make sure student and host family sign a double placement form.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Exchange Holiday Traditions!</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The holiday season is one of the most exciting times of the year for host families and their exchange students. Students are off from school and get to spend more time with their host families. They also often get the opportunity to meet many of your relatives and other out-of town guests. You'll of course want to share your holiday traditions with your student and they also may have traditions from their home countries they want to share with you.</p>
<p>You should also keep in mind that since the holidays are a family time, students may have a bout of "holiday homesickness" since they are far from their natural family. This is not uncommon and the best way to help your student is to keep them involved with your family's activities and make sure your student is not spending excessive amounts of time contacting family and friends at home.</p>
<p><strong>Five month students returning home and Convalidations</strong></p>
<p>It may seem like they just arrived, but students on the fall semester program may soon be leaving. While these departures can be emotionally trying, the bonds you've built over your time together will be long-lasting.</p>
<p>If you've hosted a semester student from Brazil, Ecuador, Italy, Spain or Mexico, you may have already heard them mention something about a "convalidation". A convalidation is an official certification of a student's transcript that they will need to present to their home school in order to get credit for the classes they took in the US.</p>
<p>It is the students' responsibility to take care of their own convalidation process, but they may need your help in securing some of the documents since they will often have to return home before their transcript is available. Usually, the host family just needs to forward the notarized transcript to the exchange student. </p>
<p>The convalidation process varies from country to country and links to the process are here:</p>
<p style="margin-left:60px;"><strong>Brazil</strong><a href="pdf/convalidation/Brazil-Convalidation.pdf" target="_blank"> &#8211; &#171; view &#187;</a><br>
  <strong>Ecuador </strong><a href="pdf/convalidation/Ecuador-Convalidation.pdf" target="_blank"> &#8211; &#171; view &#187;</a>
  <br>
  <strong>Italy</strong> <a href="pdf/convalidation/Italy-Convalidation.pdf" target="_blank"> &#8211; &#171; view &#187;</a>
  <br>
  <strong>Mexico</strong> <a href="pdf/convalidation/Mexico-Convalidation.pdf" target="_blank"> &#8211; &#171; view &#187;</a> 
  <br>
<strong>Spain</strong><a href="pdf/convalidation/Spain-Convalidation.pdf" target="_blank"> &#8211; &#171; view &#187;</a></p>
<p><em>(If your student requires a convalidation and is not from one of the countries listed above, please contact your ISE Area Representative</em>)</p>
<p><strong>Participating in Winter Sports:</strong> Many of our students will experience their first snowfall here in the U.S. and may want to try winter sports. Please make sure that students have sport-appropriate clothing and safety gear. Recreational downhill skiing, snowboarding, skating, sledding and cross country skiing are all covered winter sports on the Insurance plan. However, snowmobiling is covered only if the student is a passenger and exchange students should never operate a motorized vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Holiday Travel: </strong>School vacations and holidays are upon us and some families are planning vacations with their exchange student. Please notify your ISE Area Representative if you will be taking your exchange student out of town.</p>
<p>If your vacation plans include <strong>international travel</strong>, it is critical that you contact your representative well in advance of your trip. In order to travel internationally, your exchange student will need to get their travel authorization signed on their US entry documents (DS-2019). We'll also need to confirm that the student has a multiple entry visa. Failure to obtain this signature can create substantial problems upon your return to the US and it could mean that your exchange student might not be allowed to return to the US. Please also keep in mind that the exchange student&rsquo;s insurance does not cover international travel so they should secure a policy before they travel. There are many online travel insurance providers that offer reasonably-priced policies.</p>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3>Jan McInvale &#8211; National Director / Program Manager</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom: 10px; width: 285px; float: right;"><img src="images/employee-dec.jpg" width="285" height="202" /></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell everyone about yourself. What is your background, interests and hobbies.</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong><em>I  am a wife of 24 years to an amazing husband, mom to 3 grown sons, Nana  to 5 beautiful grandchildren and National Director/Program Manager at  ISE. My 1st career was in the insurance industry. I worked with Property  and Casualty coverage as a Commercial Lines Marketing Specialist for  many years. I decided the commute was too much and stayed at home for  about a week before being asked at church to host a Brazilian boy  "temporarily" until a permanent home could be found. My family agreed.  That was 1998 and 26 exchange students ago. I started a new career in  student exchange when our "temporary student" became a permanent part of  our life. I have been a host family, area representative, Regional  Manager, and National Director with another organization for 15 years. I&rsquo;ve been with ISE for a little over a year now and now I am looking  forward to many more years to come.</em></em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is your job function in ISE?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>As  National Director/Program Manager, I work with 10 Regional Managers across the U.S. to ensure that the students are placed into host family  homes in a timely manner and that the host family and student have a  successful exchange. Each day brings a new set of challenges and rewards from both the Manager, host family and students.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What is it about your work that is the most challenging/satisfying? </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A:</strong><em> The most challenging part of my job is that I cannot make placements or a  relocation happen quickly enough. I'm an A Type personality and like things organized and timely. When working with so many diverse  personalities, I have to do my best to understand and work with them. Patience is a virtue and I&rsquo;m slowly learning to be more patient. The  most satisfying part of my job is seeing the students and host families  enjoy their exchange. Photos are worth a thousand words and I love  seeing them on the different Facebook pages.</em></em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: Tell us something we don't know about you. </strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong>My heart's desire is to someday own a craft store. I love to make scrapbooks, cards, refurbish furniture or anything crafty. I love travel and anything that involves my family. One thing that comes to mind that  most people do not know about me is that I attended Christ for the  Nations College in the chaplaincy program. I traveled to minister in many prisons across Texas and Arkansas.</em></p>
<div class="hrLine"></div>
<p><strong>Q: What new projects are you going to be working on this year?</strong></p>
<p class="grey"><em><strong>A: </strong><em>I'm not sure yet.</em></em></p>
