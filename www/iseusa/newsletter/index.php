<h1>The Latest....</h1>

<h2><strong>New Marketing Flyers</strong></h2>

<p>We have revamped our flyers to match our new branding.  They are located in EXITS under Marketing Materials to the right of the screen.  There are two versions:<br />
  <br />
  <strong>1. Printed Materials</strong><br />
  These are PDF documents that will showcase your personal contact information.  These can be printed when you need to hang up signage at a fair, school, restaurant or as flyers to hand out to people.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>2. Social Media</strong><br />
  These are .jpg images that you can download for Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter or to send in an email.  They aren&rsquo;t customized because you should be only using these with your &ldquo;personal&rdquo; digital media.</p>

<h1>What About Bob!</h1>

<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="images/bob-news.png" width="225" height="150" alt="Happy Holidays from ISE" /></div>

<p>As we enter in to the last few months of the placing season, I cannot stress enough the importance of getting the students placed as quickly as possible. Our latest reports show us that we have close to 300 host families that have yet to start their host family applications along with 150 apps that are partially completed. Please do everything you can to move those apps along. I understand you do not want to harass your host families, but a gentle push and letting them know there is a student who is stressing out because their friends have a placement and they do not. </p>
<p>Also, I am seeing a number of host family apps that are being rejected by the Compliance Department for various reasons, many of which can be avoided. Some of the most common reasons are:</p>
<p>- Host family references not in the local community -Incomplete or unacceptable photos -Not enough rooms in the home to accommodate the family and student(s). A brief explanation in the note section would be helpful. </p>
<p>- Discrepancies between the Environment section and the Confidential Visit section -Failure to list an occupation. Self-employed is not acceptable to the DOS. </p>
<p>Remember, the sooner the apps get approved, the sooner you can link the student and get your placement payment and all bonus payments!</p>
<p>Speaking of bonuses, don't forget the recently announced Summer Bonus Bonanza along with the Early Placement and on Time Placement bonuses. Earn additional $$$$$ for all students placed in groups of five through the balance of the placing season and even more for all PreAYP and students placed by July 7th. </p>
<p>So get out there and place out kids and earn those $$$$$. <br />
  Happy Placing and as always, THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO!!!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<h3>Compliance June Update</h3>
<p>We know everyone is busy finding great families for our students and know that we in the compliance team are committed to keeping pace with the volume of applications.  We&rsquo;re committed to maintaining our 24-hour turn-around on all host applications and most are done more quickly than that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re always looking at ways to simplify the process and the newest change is an update to the &ldquo;Host Orientation Sign-off&rdquo; form.  We&rsquo;ve removed the student information from the form so you only need to get the family to sign-off on this once per year.  Please remember that DOS regulations require that the date of the orientation <strong><u>must be after</u></strong> the date the host application was approved by compliance.  Making sure this is correct before submitting the form will help eliminate any delays in processing and payments.  This form is available in the &ldquo;Letters&rdquo; section and ISE Docs in EXITS.</p>

<p>One other common issue relates to double placements.  The host application allows a host family to select &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;d like to host a second student&rdquo; when the initially fill out the app.  If they do this, you do not have to submit any more paperwork for the double placement.  However, if a family initially signs up to host one student and then decides to double-host, we will require the host family signed double placement authorization which can be emailed to the Compliance Department. &nbsp;IT is working on a change to allow the app to be sent back to the host family, but until that is implemented, we&rsquo;ll need to use the more manual process.</p>
<p>In our review of the school acceptances, we are seeing an increased number of students being linked to the wrong school in placement management. In other words, the selection of the school in EXITS is not the same school we have a signed school acceptance for. &nbsp;This issue causes the placement (and payment) to be held up until the AR or RM corrects EXITS.  Please double check your school selection prior to saving the placement information.</p>

<h3>Departure payments update</h3>
<p>Departure payments have been going out for the at least the past month.   Payments are only made if all documentation has been completed and approved by compliance, including the final progress report.  If you are missing a departure payment, make sure that all documentation for each student has been submitted.  If you think you are missing a payment that you are due, please review the following before contacting your Regional Manager, Regional Advisor or Facilitator.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Have all the progress reports been completed an approved?</li>
  <li>Are you missing any documentation, especially the student and/or host orientation signoff?</li>
  <li>Is the student a semester student?  If so, please be aware that departure payments are only made to 10-month AYP and 12-month students.</li>
  <li>Are there any duplicate progress reports?  You can check up pulling up the student and clicking on &ldquo;Progress Reports&rdquo; on the right side of the screen.   If you see multiple progress reports for the same month (e.g. two March reports) you should delete the one that is not approved.</li>

<h1>Employee Spotlight</h1>

<h3><strong>Patricia Littrell </strong>&#8211; <strong>Regional Director</strong></h3>
<div style="margin: 10px; width: 225px; float: right;"><img src="images/may-employee.png" width="225" alt=""/></div>
<p>My name is Patricia Littrell and my family calls me Trish.  I have been involved in student exchange as a Regional Manager since 1998.  I love the work I do and truly believe that the only way we can make a difference in our world is through the young people.  Like all of you, the most challenging thing I do is locate loving families to welcome our kids and then find schools to accept them.</p>

<p>I first became involved in the program when someone came to my daughter’s middle school looking for host families.  We jumped on the band wagon and have not stopped.  We currently have a wonderful young man, Antonio from Italy, living with us.  My family has hosted 16 students from Brazil, Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, France, Belarus, Armenia, Croatia and Italy.  I can honestly say it has been a very rewarding experience.  I have learned so much about other cultures and religions, as well as a tolerance and understanding for people from all over the world.</p>  

<p>I live in Loretto, Tennessee (20 minutes north of Florence, Alabama) with my husband Buster of 39 years.  We have 3 daughters, 5 grandsons and 4 granddaughters.</p>  

<p>Most of our married life was spent in the Navy.  We traveled around the country, living in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Virginia and Florida.  Buster retired from the Navy and began working for TVA in Alabama.  We moved our family from the big city of Jacksonville, Florida to our home town of Loretto, a small quite town with two stop lights.  Our kids were raised “Navy Brats” and very patriotic.  We are family oriented and try to spend as much time with our kids and grandkids as possible.  We have a large extended family on both sides so our kids have always had a lot of family around.</p>

<p>You would probably never guess it, but I am a “Motorcycle Mama”.  Buster has a Harley and off we go whenever possible.  Other than riding the Harley and spending time with family activities, I also enjoy gardening (flowers not vegetables), great Lifetime movies, scrap booking, canoeing, traveling, Civil War history and touring antebellum homes.  I occasionally put on another hat by heading a scholarship committee at my local high school.  Each year, we raise money and give a scholarship to a deserving graduate.</p> 

<p>Most of my professional career has been spent in the medical field.  I am a Medical Transcriptionist and started out working in hospitals years ago.  I also worked as a Respiratory Therapy Technician and Ophthalmic Technician.  I have worked as an Office Manger for various specialties to include Family Medicine, Ophthalmology and Neurology.  I worked for the Mayo Clinic for many years in a management position, training Medical Secretaries and overseeing the Surgical Transcription/Dictation Departments at the Clinic and St. Luke’s Hospital.  I quit the medical field and devoted all of my time to student exchange following the death of my sister to cancer.</p>  

<p>I am looking forward to many more years as part of the ISE family.  Of course, I can only say this now because it is May and not August 20th.   All jokes aside, I believe we have the best exchange program out there.  I am really proud to work with such a great group of people.</p>
