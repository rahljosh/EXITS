<h1>The Latest....</h1>

<h2>March is a Great Month to Find Host Families</h2>

<p>March is one of the biggest months for placements.  This is a great time of year to ask families if they want to host.  The holidays are now over and it’s not yet the end of the school year.  Families have time to think about hosting.</p>  
<p>Repeating families have the advantage of signing up early and getting to know their new student even better.  New families will have the extra time to plan their schedule and adjust to the exciting experience they are about to enter.</p>

<div class="hrLine"></div>

<h2>Red Cross Month</h2>

<p>Now that the weather is warmer, there are many Project HELP opportunities.  We are still in the middle of Red Cross month.  Go out and tell your students to sign up today.  To find opportunities, direct them to our Project HELP Page:

<div class="hrLine"></div>

<h2>Capture the Moments</h2>

<p>Remember, send us pictures of what your students are up to.  Sports, clubs, vacations, spring break, family time . . . . the list goes on and we want to see it! Send it all at <a href="#">socialmedia@iseusa.com</a> or message us on our facebook page <a href="http://www.facebook.com/iseusa">www.facebook.com/iseusa</a>.</p>

<h1>What about Bob!</h1>
<h3>BONUSES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BONUSES &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BONUSES</h3>
<div style="width: 225px; float: right; margin: 10px;"><img src="images/bob-news.png" width="225" height="150" alt="Happy Holidays from ISE" /></div>

<p>Congratulations to all of you who earned the Special Winter Bonus! Many of you placed more than one student in the month of February, therefore earning multiple bonuses!</p> 
<p>Please keep in mind that you can earn bonuses right up until the last day of the placing season! At this time the &ldquo;Fast Track&rdquo; bonus is in effect.</p>
<p>  <strong>Fast Track Bonus - </strong>Place five August students before <u>April 28th</u> and earn a $1500 bonus!</p> 
<p>In addition to the Fast Track Bonus, you can earn additional money by placing a Pre AYP student and if the Pre AYP student is one of Brian Feng&rsquo;s (our comedic agent from China whose company is named LAB) students earn an extra $50!  Best of all, while earning these bonuses, you are getting points toward the incentive trip to London!</p>
<p>Please consult the website for all the bonuses and details.</p>
<p>Happy placing! As always, thank you for all you do for student exchange!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<h2 style="font-family: 'Yesteryear', cursive;">Bob Keegan</h2>

<h1>Compliance Corner</h1>
<p>Congratulations to all the reps that were able to take advantage of last month's bonus.  We appreciate your patience with the time factor for the Compliance Team to review the many host family applications and school acceptances submitted.</p>
<h3>HOST FAMILY APPLICATION:</h3>
<p>When submitting a host family application for HQ approval, please be sure the photos are clear and the rooms in the home are tidy.  We will be sending apps back to reps that do not meet this criteria.</p>

<h3>SCHOOL ACCEPTANCE:</h3>

<p>We are still receiving school acceptances with missing information.  It is crucial the acceptances are accurate and complete.  This not only holds up a student receiving notification of his/her placement, but your placement payment as well.</p>
<h3>SECOND VISITS</h3>
<p>We are still experiencing a 20% denial rate for second visit reports.  Although the percentage rate has gone down tremendously, that 20% needs to be addressed.   Mainly the reason for denial has been the number of rooms listed on the first visit report compared to the number of rooms listed on the second visit report.  This holds up the second visit rep payment and the Compliance Team has to review these reports twice, utilizing time needed in another area.</p>

<h1>Facilitator Square</h1>
<p>As the end of the program nears, we&rsquo;d like to send a warm thank you to all our ISE host families.  You&rsquo;ve opened up your homes and hearts and given a young person an experience that will shape who they will become as an adult.  While we&rsquo;re sure that there have been the occasional bumps in the road, we hope that the experience for you and your family has been a very positive one.</p>
<p>After a brutal winter, we’re starting to see signs of Spring.  With the warmer weather, students and their host families start getting even busier.  Students will begin playing spring sports, getting ready for prom season and keeping busy with their school work.  This is also the time students start to think about their return home. </p>
<p>Prom season and the end of the school year can prompt a celebration.   While it is certainly a time to celebrate your student’s success, these celebrations can lead to temptations for students to engage in behaviors that are inappropriate (perhaps illegal), and a violation of ISE program rules.  Chief among these is drinking. </p> 
<p>Now would be a good time to remind students that they are not allowed to consume alcohol or be in the presence of other students doing the same.  We’d hate to see a student have to return home because of a momentary lapse of judgment.</p>
<p>With school soon coming to a close, it’s important to make sure your student maintains a focus on their studies.  For most students, their grades in the US affect their schooling back in their home countries.  Your student may just need a little encouragement to finish the year with good marks.</p>

<h3>Payment Questions</h3>
<p>At this time of year, we&rsquo;re paying supervision fees, 2nd visit payments, placement fees and placement bonuses.  While most payments are sent out within a couple days of receipt of documentation, occasionally there are delays because of missing, incomplete paperwork, non-compliant paperwork or internal processing delays.</p> 
  <p>To help ensure that you understand why a payment has been delayed, here are some things to review:<br />
  All payments are viewable in EXITS under the Users  My Information.  Please note that the payment date is the &ldquo;date&rdquo; the check was cut.  Usually checks are sent the following day.  It will typically take 4-7 additional days for the check to arrive at your home.</p>
 <p> <strong>Placement fees:</strong>  Placement fees are paid when the host family application is fully approved, the student is placed with the family and we&rsquo;ve received and approved the school acceptance form.  For single person placements, placement fees are not paid until the student has approved the placement.</p>
  <p><strong>Placement bonuses:</strong> Pre-AYP, CEO, state guarantee, Fast Track, Early Placement, On Time and any other bonuses will be paid upon approval for &ldquo;standard&rdquo; placements.  However, for double placements and single person placements, the bonuses will only be paid after the home office has received the approval from the host family and the student&rsquo;s natural family.  Please note that for bonuses with a cut-off date (e.g. CEO, Pre-AYP, etc.) we lock-in the date the placement was approved.  Even if the natural family approval comes later, the bonus will be paid if the original approval was prior to the deadline.</p>
  <p><strong>Supervision fees:</strong>  Please remember that supervision fees are paid after your RA, RM and facilitator approve the application.  Also, supervision fees are only paid if the application is fully compliant.</p>
 <p> <strong>2nd Visit Fees:</strong>  Second visit fees are paid after the second visit has been reviewed by your RA, RM and Compliance.  Please also keep in mind that second visit reports need to match up with the first visit report.   Compliance will notify your manager of any disrepency.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve checked all these items and still do not understand why something hasn&rsquo;t been paid, please contact your regional managers or regional advisor.  They should be able to quickly resolve any issue you may have.</p>
