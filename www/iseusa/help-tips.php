<h3>THE STUDENT IS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY</h3>
<p>Encourage the student to come to you with any issues or concerns first so that you have a chance to help them solve problems.</p>
<p>Provide an atmosphere of openness so that a question is welcomed and responded to in your home.</p>
<p>Communicate plans in advance so that the student can make plans as well. This especially helps if you have set plans during the week, weekend or holidays.</p>
<p>Periodically ask how the student is adjusting to the home and the family.
</p>


 <div class="dotLine">&nbsp;</div><br />
<h3>MAKING FRIENDS</h3>
<p>DO NOT EXPECT THAT AN INSTANT FRIENDSHIP WILL DEVELOP BETWEEN YOUR TEEN AND THE STUDENT.</p>
<p>Encourage the student to speak English and make American friends.</p>
<p>Encourage the student to join clubs and attend youth groups if you go to church.</p>
<p>Meet their friends as you would with your own children. Invite them to your home to get to know them.</p>
<p>Encourage the student to start a journal or picture documentation of their time in the U.S.</p>

<h3>Rules and Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>BE REALISTIC AND AGE APPROPRIATE IN SETTING RULES FOR YOUR STUDENT.</li>
    <li>Lay out the rules carefully from curfews to expected family times.</li>
    <li>Don't assume that the student will know the way you want things done including:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>laundry</li>
      <li>shower times</li>
      <li>meal time</li>
      <li>chores</li>
    </ul>
  </ul><br />
  <p>The student should adhere to your rules and expectations but they cannot do that if you do not let them know what you expect.<br>
    <br>
    Does the student understand your expectations? Talk about it up front with the student.<br>
    <br>
    If you have expectations for your children, communicate them to your exchange student so everyone's chores are understood.<br>
    <br>
    Communicate with your ISE Area Representative if there are any concerns.</p>

<h3>Changing Families</h3>
<div class="blueLine">&nbsp;</div>
<ul class="padding"><li>Changing families should not be the first thought on resolving an issue between the student and host family.</em></li>
<li>We strongly encourage both family and student(s) to work through their problems FIRST. ISE will work to counsel you and the student through issues.</em></li>
<li>Talk to the student about what you are feeling.</li>
<li>If you are not making changes, speak with your Area Representative.</li>
<li>If you must ask the student to change families, please allow the Area Representative time to find the right family.</li>
<li>ONLY THE NY OFFICE CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO SEND THE STUDENT HOME.</li>
