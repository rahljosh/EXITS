<h2>Important Things To Know</h2>
<h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />THE STUDENT IS A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY</h1><br /><br />
<ul><li>Do not treat the student like a guest, no matter how tempted you are.</li>
 <li>Encourage the student to come to you with any issues or concerns first so that you have a chance to help
them solve problems.</li>
 <li> Provide an atmosphere of openness so that a question is welcomed and responded to in your home.</li>
 <li>Communicate plans in advance so that the student can make plans as well. This especially helps if you have
set plans for holidays.</li>
 <li>Periodically ask how the student is adjusting to the home and the family.</li></ul>
<br /><hr /><br />

<h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />MAKING FRIENDS</h1>
<ul> <li>DO NOT EXPECT THAT AN INSTANT FRIENDSHIP WILL DEVELOP BETWEEN YOUR
TEEN AND THE STUDENT.</li>
 <li> Encourage the student to speak English and make American friends.</li>
 <li> Encourage the student to join clubs and attend youth groups if you go to church.</li>
 <li> Meet their friends as you would with your own children. Invite them to your home to get to know them.</li>
 <li> Encourage the student to start a journal or picture documentation of their time in the U.S.</li></ul><br /><hr /><br />

<ul> <li> ISE will work to counsel you and the student through issues.</li>
 <li> We strongly encourage both families and students to work through their problems FIRST.</li>
 <li> Talk to the student about what you are feeling.</li>
