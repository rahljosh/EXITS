<h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />What is a Host Family:</h1>
<p>A host family is a vital part of the cultural exchange, immersing the student
in a variety of activities while in the host country. The host family plays a
large role in offering the student a view of another country and gains the
opportunity to learn about a new culture from a young leader. 
Hosting is a tremendous experience in which you can share in a young
person's hopes and dreams and develop a lifelong connection with a
student and family from another country. It can be challenge to help a
young person transition to a new culture and ease into their surroundings
but the rewards are immeasurable.</p>

<h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />Who Can Host:</h1>
<p>Host families represent the diversity of American culture.
Host families are of varied economic, religious and racial
backgrounds and include working parents, couples
without children, singles and single parents, adoptive
parents, and empty nesters. Host families live in all 50
states of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii.
You don't need to have teenagers to host &#8211; you can host
if you have young children, adult children, or no children
at all. If yours is a non-traditional household interested in
sharing your home with a foreign exchange scholarship
student,  ISE will consider your
application to host following special selection procedures.</p><!--end HFgradient --></div>
