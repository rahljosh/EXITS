          <ul>
            <li><strong>In schools</strong> the world stage will grow in tolerance, understanding and appreciation for diversity when students befriend EXCHANGE STUDENTS whose backgrounds are very different from their own.</li>
<li><strong>In your community,</strong> worldwide events will take on a new significance when EXCHANGE STUDENTS from countries in the news are in your community and ready to share their perspectives and experiences.</li>
<li><strong>In schools the language classes</strong> will come alive with native accents, colloquialisms and contextual usage. EXCHANGE STUDENTS can clearly show how language and culture are intertwined.</li>
<li><strong>In your school, History, Social Studies, Government and World Affairs</strong> classes will be infused with different cultural perspectives which make discussion an exciting &quot;compare and contrast&quot; exercise.</li>
<li><strong>In your family, school, and community,</strong> Americans will learn more about their own cultural views and how they affect life in the U.S. by exchanging ideas with exchange students.</li>
<li><strong>In your family</strong>, a comparison of one's personal values with those of another may prove to be enlightening.</li>
<li><strong>In your school, faculty, staff, and students </strong>will develop an understanding of the interrelatedness of our lives and will learn to view themselves as world citizens. Just as with HOSTING, this experiential learning LASTS A LIFETIME.</li>
<li><strong>In your family,</strong> exposure to different cultures will grow a deeper appreciation for what they have and for the tremendous challenges facing other nations.</li>
<li><strong>In your schools, </strong>your exchange student will add new dimensions to the activities of your schools' international clubs and organizations.</li>
<li><strong>In your communities,</strong> exchange students bring special talents and skills and are eager to get involved.<br />
<li><strong>In your family,</strong> the &quot;HOSTING EXPERIENCE&quot; will increase involvement in the educational forces related to school activities.</li></ul>
