<p><strong>1. How much do HOST FAMILIES receive for HOSTING a STUDENT?</strong><br />

  EXCHANGE STUDENTS enjoy living on farms, in small towns, suburbs and big cities. Every community offers the opportunity for friendship and learning.

<div id="q11">
<p><strong>11. How much does HOSTING cost?</strong><br />
 Your financial responsibility is quite minimal. If you can afford food on the table, that's basically enough. Your EXCHANGE STUDENT'S natural parents will pay for all travel costs, program fees and health insurance. They will also provide the EXCHANGE STUDENT with a monthly spending allowance used for school expenses, social activities, clothing and other essentials. A $50 per month tax deduction can be claimed for each month you host.</p></div>

<p><strong>18. Can young children benefit from HOSTING?</strong><br />
