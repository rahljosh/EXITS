ID card given to each student. Additional information can be found in the insurance flyers/booklets that have been
sent to all students.</p>
<p>For additional copies of insurance flyers/booklets, claim forms and/or new insurance ID cards please
  log into www.esecutive.com/MyInsurance or contact your local Area Representative or the ISE

  <p><strong>Host families should not use their own medical insurance when taking a student to a medical provider.</strong>
