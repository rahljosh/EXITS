   <p><a href="meet-our-students.cfm"><strong>Click here to find out more!</strong></a> Many host families have questions about foreign students. We can say that students who are successful in the ISE program share several positive characteristics.</p>  

<p>They are sincerely eager to learn about America first hand. They are willing to be flexible and adaptable as they learn to live in their new home.</p> 
<p>
They are respectful towards the school and family which have made this year possible. They speak English well enough to function in an American school and home. They are at least above average students in their own country.</p>  

<p>They understand that ISE does not promise a diploma or graduation, sports participation or a driver's license. Students must have their own spending money - enough to cover school supplies, school fees and personal items.<br /><br /><img src="images/hostFamily/learnMore.png" width="80" height="10" /></p></div>

          <p>Being a host family is a wonderful experience that enriches the lives of students and families throughout the world. By accepting a foreign exchange student into your home, you are opening your heart and mind to a culture and helping to bridge the gap between two different countries.<br /><br />

<div class="HFgradient"><h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />What are the requirements on becoming an ISE host family?</h1>
          <p>To be an ISE host family, you must be able to provide a warm and loving home with full room and board. </p>
          <p>Students may share a room with siblings of the same sex. A host family consists of two or more people related by blood or marriage. Single parents with children may host  if they meet the ISE requirements. Your application to become a host family will be reviewed by local ISE. <img src="images/hostFamily/learnMore.png" width="80" height="10" /></p></div><br />
          <h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />What kind of support will I have  as an ISE host family?</h1>
          <p>All host families are assigned a supervising area representative to help you through the entire process from beginning to end. The supervising representative will be with you every step of the way providing extensive guidance and support during the student's exchange program. <img src="images/hostFamily/learnMore.png" width="80" height="10" /></p><br />
          <div class="HFgradient"><h1 class="HFheader"><img src="images/hostFamily/HF_arrow.png" width="18" height="15" alt="arrow" />Do I have to pay anything to be a host family?</h1>
          <p>We ask host families to provide basic room and board. Students coming to the United States through ISE will arrive with spending cash and health insurance. <img src="images/hostFamily/learnMore.png" width="80" height="10" /></p></div><br />
