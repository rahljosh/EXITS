Our goal of bringing people of the world closer together is what motivates our national and regional offices on a daily basis.<br>
                      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also very proud of our representatives in the field. They are deeply committed to bringing the message of our foreign exchange program to all of its participants, including our schools and families. We know that we can and do affect change within our ever-shrinking world. The love and care that our families and schools display toward our students are what make our organization successful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know we are involved in a lofty and difficult mission. That is what makes us strive for perfection. The knowledge gained by a homestay and school experience affects everyone. We thank you, our families, schools and International Representatives for helping us make such a wonderful endeavor possible.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All of our programs are carefully designed. We are proud to say that our administration is educationally oriented as teachers and educational administrators make up our national headquarters team. We are fully aware that such important programs require careful planning and organization as well as care, love, and attention.<br>
