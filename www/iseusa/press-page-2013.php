    <h3>A Foreign Exchange Student Volunteers with the Salvation Army</h3>
<p>Loretto, TN &#8211; December 18th, 2013 &#8211; Antonio Giribaldi, an exchange student, volunteered along with his host family to help the Salvation Army. Antonio stood outside in a shopping complex for hours to raise money.</p>  
  <div class="clearfix"></div> 

<p>Antonio came to the US from Italy through International Student Exchange (ISE). He came here to have a new experience while refining his English skills. Antonio settled in very nicely. He joined his football team, became friends with a few people at school and even got to know his new neighbors. He really enjoys it when his extended family visits.

<p>"I have become good friends with my host nieces. They are a lot of fun to hang out with. My host family makes it very comfortable to live here", stated Antonio.</p>
<p>It was his host sisters that got him involved with the Salvation Army. Antonio had volunteered back in Italy with the local Boy Scouts. He said he heard of the Salvation Army before, but never had any interaction with them. His host sisters signed him up to stand outside for hours to collect money.  
"It was very cold, volunteering to collect money. In the end, I felt like I really helped some people" explained Antonio.</p>
<p>Antonio plans to do more community service in the future.  He’s not sure what his next opportunity will be, but he likes giving back to his new community.  
"I really enjoy living in the US. I hope to get more involved in my community throughout the year." said Antonio.</p>

    <h3>International Exchange Students Pick up the &quot;Tab&quot; for Charity</h3>
<p>Long Prairie, MN &#8211; November 20th, 2013 &#8211; Exchange students from International Student Exchange (ISE), collected over two boxes full of soda tabs for the local Ronald McDonald House Chapter. The soda tabs can be resold for funds.</p> 
  <div class="clearfix"></div> 

<p>ISE, a student exchange organization, runs a community service program called Project HELP. Each foreign exchange student must do 5 hours of community service.  Most students go above and beyond that number. In Minnesota, the students collect soda tabs and donate them to the Ronald McDonald House Charities for their Project HELP contribution.

<p>"We have done this for the last 17-18 years. It becomes a community event as churches, sports teams and classmates give the exchange students their tabs" Rose Hawkins, Regional Director for ISE.</p>

 <p>Rose runs the region for ISE and is the main organizer for this program. Every year, Rose collects soda tabs from her foreign exchange students. For every sandwich size baggie of soda tabs, the student receives one hour of community service time. They still have 4 hours to complete their Project HELP goal.</p>
 <p>"Each year we collect at least 2 full paper boxes.  On a good year, have collected over 4 boxes" stated Rose.</p>

    <h3>An Exchange Student Volunteers with FEMA to Help During the Colorado Floods</h3>

<p>Longmont, CO &#8211; November 1st, 2013 &#8211; Ana Beatriz Correa, an ISE exchange student, volunteered with FEMA to assist her community after the Colorado floods back in early September. The floods caused damaged to over 20,000 homes while destroying roads, bridges and businesses.</p> 

<p>Ana, an ISE exchange student, is from San Paulo, Brazil. She came to the US to experience a new culture and to refine her English speaking skills. She was placed with the Spencer family, who live in Longmont, CO. Shortly after Ana settled into her new town, she experienced a major storm that left her town in a crisis.<a href="#" id="example4-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example4');return false;">Read More &#187;</a></p>
<div id="example4" class="more4">
<p class="p1">"I was on a hill, so I wasn't nervous about my host family house. I did walk down to see the flooding. I was shocked to see roads covered with water and bridges destroyed," explained Ana.</p>
    <p>Ana didn't do much the next couple of days.  School was cancelled for the week. Ana also kept up with family from Brazil, assuring them she was safe. By the 3rd day, Ana woke up and decided she wanted to help her community.  She had volunteered before back in Brazil at an adoption agency.  Ana realized that her community needs her.</p>  
    <p>"Why should I sit in my bedroom if I could be out doing something?" Ana asked herself.</p> 
    <p>She then told her host mom the next day that she wanted to help. Her host most called a friend she knew that was involved in the community. Ana was able to get connected with FEMA. She was assigned to take supply orders for families that had their house damaged. She never heard of FEMA before.  There was nothing like FEMA in Brazil.</p>  
    <p>"After the first day, I thought I was really helping people. It made me go back and help again," commented Ana.</p>
    <p>Ana told us things are starting to get back to normal in Longmont, but there is still a lot of work to do.</p>

    <h3>International Student Exchange (ISE) Honors its Founders Barbara and Bob Fink as Part of its 30th Anniversary Celebration</h3>

<p>Hauppauge, NY &#8211; October 5th, 2013 &#8211; The founders of International Student Exchange, Barbara and Bob Fink, were honored and thanked by current CEO Wayne Brewer last Monday as ISE celebrates their 30th anniversary.</p> 
  <div class="clearfix"></div> 

<p>Accepting the award was Julie Maes, Bob's sister and a current ISE Manager. Bob and Barbara founded the company in 1982 and Julie started her managerial career as well in that year. Bob was unable to accept the award personally due to Barbara's recent passing.

<div id="example3" class="more3">
    <p>Bob and Barbara were host parents on several occasions prior to starting ISE in 1982. They were not happy with the exchange company from which their students came and decided that they could do better. They felt that if the exchange program was designed to bring people of the world closer together, than it had to be operated in a qualitative manner.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, ISE is proud to state that it still maintains the same mission that Bob and Barbara put forth and its J-1 Secondary School Program. ISE still maintains the high level and spirit that its founders demanded in 1982.</p>
<p>ISE is very proud and grateful for the vision and devotion of its two founders.</p>

<p>Hauppauge, NY &#8211; October 18th, 2013 &#8211; The founders of International Student Exchange, Barbara and Bob Fink, were honored and thanked by current CEO Wayne Brewer last Monday as ISE celebrates their 30th anniversary.</p> 

<p>"Since we place students at so many different high schools in MI, we wanted a central location where our students and host families could come to us.

    <h3>International Student Exchange (ISE) Places Nearly 2,800 Foreign Exchange Students in 2013</h3>

<p>Hauppauge, NY &#8211; September 17th, 2013 &#8211; The International Student Exchange (ISE), which has been placing international students since 1982, will place nearly 2,800 exchange students in 49 different states for the year 2013.</p> 
<p>"Placing this many students showcases the generosity of the people in this country.  Our host families aren't compensated for opening up their home to these students." said Bob Keegan, Executive Director....<a href="#" id="example1-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example1');return false;">Read More &#187;</a></p>
<div id="example1" class="more1">
    <p>ISE places high school students (between the ages 15 &#187; 18 & 6 months) throughout the country on one year J1 Visas. This program is designated by the Department of State. It allows high school students to stay one year and learn about the United States while attending high school.</p>  
 <p>The exchange students live with a host family that provides a bed and several meals a day, as well as a loving environment. The host family does not receive any compensation for doing this. Wayne Brewer, CEO of International Student Exchange states. "Since our host families aren't paid, they do it to bring a new culture into their house. Most host families are amazed on how great the experience is."</p>
 <p>The students participate in school sports, theater, clubs and community service.  They are treated as a family member rather than a foreign exchange student.</p>
 <p>"The students really do become part of the family. They do chores, participate in activities and help out their community. It's why we have so many repeat host families," explained Wayne.</p>

<h4><em>ISE students next year are going to volunteer at Ronald McDonald Houses throughout the country</em></h4>
    <p> Hauppauge, NY &#8211; August 19th, 2013 &#8211; The International Student Exchange (ISE), which places almost 3,000 foreign exchange students a year, is partnering up with RMHC to provide community service hours, through the Charity's cornerstone program &#8211; the Ronald McDonald House, Chapter kits and possible fundraising activities.</p> 

<p>ISE started a volunteer student program called "Project HELP" back in 2006. The program is designed to increase community service for their foreign exchange students. Each student completes a minimum of five hours. Most students surpass their minimum requirement...<span class="blueText"><a href="#" id="example2-show" class="showLink" onclick="showHide('example2');return false;">Read More &#187;</a></span></p>
    
    <div id="example2" class="more2">
    <p>"Project Help has really taken off the past couple of years," said Wayne Brewer, CEO of International Student Exchange. This year we wanted to partner up with a national organization that could provide our students great community service opportunities. The Ronald McDonald House program offers that opportunity."</p> 
<p>RMHC is known throughout the U.S. as one of the most reputable family-centered charities. It will give ISE students the chance to work within their community and nationally. ISE also encourages host families and friends to participate.</p> 
<p>Gary Lubrat, Project Help Co-Chair stated, "We want the students to learn how important it is to give back to their community.  After they end their experience in the United States, we want them to continue to help people once they return home.  RMHC, and the Ronald McDonald House program will allow them to do that."</p>
