<p>The International Student Exchange Program provides full medical and accident insurance coverage for their students.  There will be a local representative to assist families and students during the hosting period. The foreign exchange students provide their own pocket money, host families are asked only to cover the cost of room and board. While no compensation is paid to those volunteer host families experiencing the Foreign Exchange Hosting Experience, the Internal Revenue Service has authorized families hosting for government-designated NON-PROFIT exchange programs, like ISE, to claim a $ 50.00 per month charitable contribution deduction on their itemized tax returns.</p>
<p>Just as there is no such thing as a typical student, there is also no such thing as a typical host family. Single-parent families, retired couples, families with only young children, as well as families with teenagers, have all had successful Hosting Experiences. The most important criteria for a host family is a genuine interest to share the American culture with a foreign exchange student while caring for the well-being of the foreign exchange student.</p>
<p>During the time of the student exchange hosting experience, we ask that you treat your new son or daughter exactly as you would your own children. The exchange student will share the ups and downs of your everyday life. By the time she or he leaves, they will have become a part of the very fabric of your own family.</p>
