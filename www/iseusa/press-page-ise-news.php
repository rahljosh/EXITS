<p class="smSize">Posted:  January 15, 2014</p>

  <p>Daniel Maring arrived in the United States just five months ago, unsure of the road ahead.</p>
  <p>He  had vacationed before with his parents to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and  San Francisco, but spending a whole school year in a new country alone  was an entirely new experience.</p>
  <p>A native of Nieuw-Roden, a village  in the Netherlands, Maring flew to New York and then Chicago in August  right before the start of Kankakee Valley's school year. He is spending  his senior year with Wheatfield residents Troy and Michelle Hanselman,  and as a member of the Kougars' varsity basketball team.</p>

  <p>This new opportunity is thanks to two  16-year-old exchange students enrolled at Weir High School. Bill  Galloway, a local attorney, is hosting Claudia Diaz, who is visiting  from Spain, and Barbara Sulimanova, who is visiting from Slovakia for  the school year.</p>
