                For a foreign student, spending a semester or year in the US is the fulfillment 
  of a lifetime dream. American culture plays an important role all over the 
  world. English language is the international language of our times. And American 
  families are known the world over for their warmth and generosity.<br>
  <br>
When a student returns to his/her own country, he/she will have gained maturity and insight into our culture and way of life as well as his/her own. They will have achieved a high level of fluency in English and will have participated in the most democratic of all school systems. Depending on their interests and abilities, they may have played in sports, participated in drama productions or performed in an American band or orchestra. The friends they make and the American family they have learned to love will be treasured forever.<br>
  <br>
Some students come to the US after graduating from high school in their own country. These serious students are truly interested in learning about life in the US. They often enjoy taking classes that might not be available in their own country.<br>
              <br>
Other students come to the US and need to have their courses convalidated in their own country in order to get credit for the year they have spent in the United States.<br>
              <br>
Still other students come to the US and know that they will not get credit at home for their classes, yet they come in order to spend a year in the US and enjoy all the experiences of being an exchange student that this program will provide them.</p>
