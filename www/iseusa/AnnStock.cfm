  <h2>Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs, Ann Stock</h2>
  <p>&quot;Hosting not only makes a difference in the life of an exceptional student; it is also an enriching experience for host families and communities. Host families and communities have the opportunity to learn about other cultures and traditions, and often establish friendships that last a lifetime. Some of the thousands of exceptional young people who come to study in the United States each year are participating in Department of State-sponsored exchanges.</p>
<p>&quot;...Host families exemplify some of our country's greatest values -- tolerance, generosity, civic engagement -- and the goodwill they exhibit helps to create a positive view of the United States that lasts a lifetime and has a ripple effect through American communities and the exchange students' communities abroad. Hosting is a wonderful way to share ideas, celebrate commonalities, bridge differences, challenge stereotypes, and experience a different culture.&quot;</p>
