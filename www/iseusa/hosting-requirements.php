<h1>Host Family Requirements</h1>
<p>Being a host family is a wonderful experience that enriches the lives of students and families throughout the world. By accepting a foreign exchange student into your home, you are opening your heart and mind to a new culture. This will help to bridge the gap between two different countries.</p><div class="dotLine">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>What's Required to be a Host Family</h3>
<p>We ask host families to provide basic room and board. Students coming to the United States through ISE will arrive with spending money and health insurance.</p>
<p>Students may share a room with siblings of the same sex. A host family consists of many different forms. Single parents with children may host if they meet the ISE requirements. Your application to become a host family will be reviewed by local ISE representative.</p> 
<p>Host families are assigned a supervising area representative to help you through the entire process from beginning to end. The supervising representative will be with you every step of the way providing extensive guidance and support during the student's exchange program.</p>

<h3>Who Can Host?</h3>

<p>Host families represent the diversity of American culture. They are of varied economic, religious and racial backgrounds and include working parents, couples without children, singles and single parents, adoptive parents, and empty nesters. Host families live in all 50 states of the United States, including Alaska and Hawaii. You don't need to have teenagers to host – you can host if you have young children, adult children, or no children at all.<br><br>To have someone from ISE contact you about hosting, please fill out our <a href="ready-host-student.cfm"><font color="#3366FF">contact form</font></a>. </p>
