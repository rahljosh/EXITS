<h2>Who was Jordan Nagler?</h2>

<p>Jordan Nagler joined the ISE family in 2001.  After graduating from Idaho State University, Jordan moved to New York to pursue his degree in Finance.  After meeting Wayne Brewer on the golf course, he came to ISE.  It quickly became obvious of his strength in the field and he became the Executive Director of International Student Exchange in  2003 and held that position until his untimely passing in October of 2008. Durring those years, he helped grow and strengthen the ISE family and the exchange industry as well.  </p>

Rather than deterring Ricardo, this only encouraged him to teach himself English through reading and studying which he began doing at the age of 8. He now speaks English very well and will have no language problem in an American high school. He has proven that hard work and dedication pay off by maintaining an A average in all of his studies. In his free time he enjoys participating in gymnastics, basketball, and community service work. Although Ricardo is only 17, he has taken the hardships in his life and turned them into learning experiences. This has transformed him into a gracious and determined young man who appreciates and takes advantage of every opportunity available to him.</p>
