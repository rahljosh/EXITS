  Students must have enough English to be able to successfully participate in the ISE

few weeks in the US. </span></div></td>

  They hope to gain a greater understanding of America and to have had a cultural 
experience. In addition, they hope for the opportunity to take the courses they 
need for credit in their home country. Although graduation is never promised or 
required, most students need to follow a course of study which will be 
recognized in their own school. Failure to do so may result in that student 
forfeiting a year of credit at home. <BR>

to the US for a year?</strong><br>
  Since ISE cannot guarantee a high school diploma, many students elect to 
complete their education at home before coming here. These students use their 
year in the US as a bridge to their future. </span></div></td>

  The ISE Area Representative can assist the school with resolving any concerns 
that the school or student may have. The ISE Area Representative also secures 
permission for the student to attend that high school. The ISE Area Representative 
also selects and screens the host family and provides supervision to the student
