            <p>Most airline tickets are non-refundable, which means that you will not get a refund for the ticket if you do not travel.  Most airlines will allow you to use the value of ticket to purchase another ticket later but they will charge a fee to change the ticket, which is usually is approximately $100.00 fee.  If you want to purchase a refundable ticket, make sure you indicate this choice when our travel agent contacts you.</p>

          <p>How do I pay for a trip?</p>
          <span class="normtext">
            <p>You can pay by Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover credit cards.  We do not accept cash or ATM Debit Cards. You can register online or call us with credit card information over telephone. Send permission forms to MPD Tour America, Inc. not to CASE.</p>

          <p>I paid you online and you didnâ€™t respond?</p>
          <span class="normtext">
            <p>Sometimes it takes a few weeks until we process all the students.  It does not mean that we automatically take payments immediately as soon as you submit it online.  Your deposit form gets processed through credit card companies, banks, etc., and this takes time to complete all the students applying for trips.</p>

            <p>Yes once we process your payment and it is accepted from the credit card. you will be notified by e-mail or by telephone with confirmation number.  If you do not hear either way from us within 2 weeks please call or write us so you can be sure you sent the information and we received it.  Sometimes students move to another home and we cannot contact them.</p>

          <p>What happens if I change my mind about a tour selection or want to cancel a trip?</p>
          <span class="normtext">
          <p>If you cancel more than 60 days before the tour date, you will receive a full refund, less a $25.00 processing fee.  If you cancel between 45-60 days before the tour, there will be a $100.00 cancellation fee.  If you cancel less than 45 days before the tour date, there will absolutely be no refunds under any circumstances.<br />
