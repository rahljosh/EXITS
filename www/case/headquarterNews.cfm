      <p>A new beginning is always exciting for everyone. We all seem eager to focus on the future especially when  we deal with teenagers. Everyone at CASE is very proud of our company  and we look forward to having the best exchange company possible. We have taken major strides recently to ensure that CASE will be able to provide the best possible service to our schools, students, families and field personnel.<br />
        <br />
        Our mission “To Bring The World Together, One Student At A Time” allows us a great place to start. What a great goal to have as our standard of operation for our program.<br />
        <br />
        The knowledge gained by everyone involved in such a great program as the Academic Year Program, helps us all to reach out to fulfill our company’s mission. Our students, our families, our schools and even our reps and office personnel all want to affect change in our ever shrinking world. The love and care that our reps, families and schools show toward our students are what will make our organization successful.<br />
        <br />
        Everyone at CASE  knows that we can all make a great difference in this world when we work together to achieve our lofty goals.  We love what we are doing and it is truly an extra special joy to be involved in such a special program that makes our efforts well worth it!<br />
        <br />
        Thank you for allowing CASE to play a very important role in today’s world by helping to bring people closer together.</p>
