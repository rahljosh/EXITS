  <p class="header2">Host Families</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CASE is ready to help you experience the joy of student exchange.&nbsp; Give your family the experience of a lifetime.&nbsp; When you host a student, you make friends all over the world and prepare your family for the global world of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have the opportunity to share love and kindness while learning about another country’s customs, traditions and culture without ever leaving home.</p>
    <p> All families participating in the CASE program are volunteer host families who are interested in opening their homes and sharing their lives with a teenager from abroad.&nbsp; These families understand the value of cultural exchange and the positive message that hosting an international student can bring to a local community.&nbsp; We value our host families and truly believe that those families who decide to host an international student are helping to create goodwill in their community, local school and throughout the United States. </p>
    <p>CASE is looking for caring families of all backgrounds.&nbsp; Families without children at home can host, as long as the family is willing to help the student meet local teens.&nbsp; When volunteering to be a host parent, your obligation is to provide meals and lodging for your new family member.&nbsp; Your student is required to bring $300 per month for his or her own expenses and personal needs and CASE provides the student with full medical coverage.&nbsp; The IRS also allows a $50 per month deduction from your income taxes for charitable contributions when the student becomes a member of your household.&nbsp; Of course we ask you to treat your student as a member of the family.</p>
    <p>Students are selected by CASE and our partners in their home countries.&nbsp; The student and their parents have been interviewed and their references checked to determine whether they have maturity, English comprehension, academic ability, versatility, and genuine interest to live in a new country.&nbsp; They receive extensive preparation and orientations before they arrive.</p>
    <p>Every host family will have the opportunity to choose their student from a diverse group of students.&nbsp; Our Area Representatives will bring you information about several students with interests similar to yours.&nbsp; Select the student that best fits your family.&nbsp; Our CASE Area Representatives and Regional Managers will help you every step of the way and are always available should you have any questions or concerns.&nbsp; With your high school’s approval, we will notify the overseas family of the acceptance and then letters, emails, phone calls begin, as you both eagerly await the day of arrival.&nbsp; Once the student has arrived, your Area Representative will assist and counsel you throughout your student’s stay in the United States.&nbsp; </p>
