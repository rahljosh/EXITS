Starting with students arriving in January 2006, students can choose a state guarantee.
Any state in the union, except for Hawaii and Alaska, can now be requested.  As always, Florida and California can still be requested.  If the state requested is not available, the International Representative will be informed
at the time of acceptance.<br><br>
Both state and regional guarantees are available for all students, both semester, and academic year students.<br><br>
If you would like to specify states, select yes at the bottom of this page, select three states of choice and print this page,
sign it and upload it back into the system with original signatures.<br><br>
