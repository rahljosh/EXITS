      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>At Cultural Academic Student Exchange, we have a goal of bringing people of the world together in life changing ways.&nbsp; In order to accomplish this endeavor, we look to find caring, capable people to work together with us to accomplish this goal.&nbsp; The people who support the students while they are in the host families and communities are called Area Representatives.</p>
      <p>Area Representatives work in their home communities to identify and screen volunteer host families who will host the foreign teenagers during their stay here.&nbsp; These Area Representatives supervise the students throughout the year and stay in touch with the high school and monitor the studentâ€™s progress.&nbsp; CASE provides a comprehensive training program, which includes how to work with students, schools and host families.&nbsp; Additionally, all representatives are trained on how to identify and resolve problems.&nbsp; Area Representatives are supported by a team of Regional Managers placed across the country, as well as the headquarters staff based in New Jersey.&nbsp; Together, these two groups are available to provide support, help and supervision to all participants in the program.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>        Area Representatives are well respected in the communities and are familiar with the schools and communities in which they live. &nbsp;If you are the type of individual dedicated to making a difference in your local community and are interested in this role, we look forward to having you apply to our program as an Area Representative.&nbsp; You too can make this a life changing experience of your own!<br />
