<p>Founded in 1997, CSB International, Inc. (CSB) is a cultural exchange organization designated by the United States Department of State as a sponsor for the J-1 Summer Work Travel and Trainee Exchange Visitor Programs.

Our mission is to encourage the development of mutual awareness, respect, concern and trust among people from different nations. What a great goal to have as our standard of operation in bringing people of the world closer together. </p><br />
