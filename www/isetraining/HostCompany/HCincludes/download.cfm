<p align="left">Thank you for your interest in the ISE Training Experience Program! The ISE Training Experience Program is an Exchange Visitor Program under which young professionals from overseas have the opportunity to receive training in the United States.</p>
<p align="left">The primary objectives of the ISE Training Experience Program are to enhance the skills and expertise of foreign nationals in their academic or occupational fields through participation in a structured and guided work-based training program. The program strives to improve the participants' knowledge of American techniques, methodologies, and expertise. The Trainee Program is also intended to increase participants' understanding of American culture and society and to enhance Americans' knowledge of foreign cultures and skills through an open interchange of ideas between participants and their American associates. A key goal of the Fulbright- Hays Act, which authorizes this program, is that participants will return to their home countries and share their experiences with their countrymen.</p>
