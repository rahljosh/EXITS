<h2><strong>SSN and registering for payrol</strong>l</h2>
<p>All trainees must obtain Social Security Numbers (SSN) for payroll purposes. You will need to apply for a Social Security Number on your own behalf and in person at any local office of the Social Security Administration (SSA). To locate the nearest SSA office, please visit <a href="http://www.ssa.gov" class="black">www.ssa.gov</a>. Please bring your passport, I-94 card and the form DS-2019 for identification purposes. It may also be useful to take along the CSB Sponsorship Letter and the documents proving your trainee status.Â  Please do not leave the originals of these important documents with the Social Security office.</p>
<p>You will receive a receipt indicating that you have applied for a Social Security Card. You should then receive your Social Security Card via U.S postal service within two to four weeks. The process might take up to six weeks if the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is delayed with screening and updating your records.</p>
<p>Please note that you can be registered on a host company's payroll prior to being issued a Social Security Number. In this case, you must present the receipt of having submitted your application to the Social Security Administration. Your host company will then be able to enroll you in their payroll by using the temporary number on your Social Security receipt. Please inform your host company as soon as you receive your permanent Social Security Number. </p>
<p>Please note that CSB participants are exempt from Social Security, Medicare and Federal Unemployment Taxes. Participants of this program are, however, subject to all applicable federal, state and local tax withholdings.
