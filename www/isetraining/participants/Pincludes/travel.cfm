<h2><strong>Traveling Abroad Requirements</strong></h2>
<p>Before travelling abroad, make sure that you have a multiple entry visa. If you do, you must send your original Form DS-2019 to ISE for travel validation. (Not doing so may cause you to be detained at the border upon your return and/or refused entry into the United States upon your return). Please include a note along with your Form DS-2019 confirming the dates you will be out of the country and the address where you would like your form returned. To have your Form DS-2019 returned via express mail, include a self-addressed, pre-paid envelope (DHL, FEDEX, USPS, etc.).  Please note that you are only allowed to travel outside the United States for up to 30 consecutive days.  You must re-enter the US before the DS-2019 end date (please see the line #3 of your DS form).  The travel authorization signature is valid for 12 months and your form DS-2019 needs to be reauthorized if you intend to travel abroad.</p>
