<h2>Life in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Life could be quite different outside your own country and normally a lot of people experience a cultural shock at the beginning of the program. In order to smooth its effects and to get a better experience from your Training program it is important that you learn as much as possible about the US, its culture and traditions. You can use our resources provided on the website, manuals and brochure, as well as do your own research, to do so.
