    <h3>Community Information</h3>
    <p>Situated in northwestern Florida, Marianna lies just under Alabama and Georgia, and is
often referred to as "The Panhandle." Located just 60 miles west of Tallahassee, Florida's
capital, one is only an hour away from the largest metropolitan area in the region. With two
large shopping centers, a five-story IMAX theater, a planetarium and several universities,
Tallahassee is a fun and exciting getaway for anyone! There is much to do in Marianna
as well, which has been affectionately nicknamed "The City of Southern Charm." With a
downtown area that has been restored to resemble how it did many decades ago, Marianna
experiences long, subtropical summers and shorter, milder winters. Only a short distance
lies the Florida Caverns State Park, which offers swimming, hiking, snorkeling, paddling
trails, camping, cave diving and much more. Connected to the state park and the Chipola
River is the Blue Hole Spring, which has extremely blue water, caused by a high amount
of limestone in the water. This beautiful area is also home to multiple golf courses, an
outlet mall and a local drive-in theater. There is no shortage of interesting and stimulating
adventures waiting for you in Marianna!</p>
