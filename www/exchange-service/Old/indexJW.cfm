  <h1> Exchange Service International</h1>
  <p>ESI gives students the ability to further their education while learning about the American culture.   ESI students live with an American family and attend a public high school in the American city of their choice, therefore being provided with an exciting backdrop for their high school education and cultural experience.</p>  
<p>ESI accepts qualified students ages 14-18 to attend public high schools in the United States and experience the American way of life for either an academic year or one semester.  Students are carefully screened and selected to be sure they possess academic achievement, exemplary character, adaptability and sufficient command of the English language.  American families provide students with room, board and a willingness to make the student a part of their family.</p>  
<p>At ESI, we strive to increase cultural awareness by immersing our students in the American way of life while giving them the freedom to choose the city and school in which they want to study.   This attractive program allows students to share their lives with an American family and find the school that will best fit their needs academically, socially and geographically. </p> 
<p>Thank you for browsing our website to learn more about the ESI program and our public high schools.</p>
