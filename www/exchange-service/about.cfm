    <p>ESI gives students the ability to attend an American public school while furthering their education and learning about the American culture. ESI students live with an American family and attend a public high school in the American city of their choice, therefore being provided with an exciting backdrop for their high school education and cultural experience.</p>
<p>All families participating in the ESI program are families who are interested in opening their homes and sharing their lives with a teenager from abroad. These families understand the value of cultural exchange and the positive message that hosting an international student can bring to a local community. We value our host families and truly believe that those families who agree to host an international student are helping to create goodwill in their community, local school, and throughout the United States.</p>
