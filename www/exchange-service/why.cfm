  <h2> Why Choose ESI</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ESI students have the ability to choose the school district where they will spend their exchange program. ESI offers many sought after locations in the United States including Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and many more cities to come.</li>
    <li>ESI accepts applications later than most other programs, allowing students to apply as late as two months before their program would begin.</li>
    <li>ESI staff can assist students to pick the school that would best fit their needs, therefore making certain that the school has the sport or club the student wants to participate in during their exchange program.  </li>
    <li>ESI students receive all of the same benefits of an American student, allowing them to receive official school transcripts for college admission and possibly even graduate at the end of their program if all criteria are met.</li>
    <li>ESI students are placed with host families in their school communities.  These host families are paid to host ESI students and are excited to share American culture and their family life with a student.</li>
    <li>ESI staff will assist the student in choosing a school and supporting the student throughout the year to be sure all student goals have been reached before completing the year!</li>
  </ul>
